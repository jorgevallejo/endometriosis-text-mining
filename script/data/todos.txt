BACKGROUND: Tissue factor pathway inhibitor 2 (TFPI2) is a novel serum biomarker 
that discriminates ovarian clear cell carcinoma (CCC) from borderline ovarian
tumors (BOTs) and non-clear cell epithelial ovarian cancers (EOCs). Here, we
examined the performance of TFPI2 for preoperative diagnosis of CCC.
METHODS: Serum samples were obtained preoperatively from patients with ovarian
masses, who needed surgical treatment at five hospitals in Japan. The diagnostic 
powers of TFPI2 and cancer antigen 125 (CA125) serum levels to discriminate CCC
from BOTs, other EOCs, and benign lesions were compared.
RESULTS: A total of 351 patients including 69 CCCs were analyzed. Serum TFPI2
levels were significantly higher in CCC patients (mean ± SD, 508.2 ± 812.0 pg/mL)
than in patients with benign lesions (154.7 ± 46.5), BOTs (181 ± 95.5) and other 
EOCs (265.4 ± 289.1). TFPI2 had a high diagnostic specificity for CCC (79.5%). In
patients with benign ovarian endometriosis, no patient was positive for TFPI2,
but 71.4% (15/21) were CA125 positive. TFPI2 showed good performance in
discriminating stage II-IV CCC from BOTs and other EOCs (AUC 0.815 for TFPI2
versus 0.505 for CA125) or endometriosis (AUC 0.957 for TFPI2 versus 0.748 for
CA125). The diagnostic sensitivity of TFPI2 to discriminate CCC from BOTs and
other EOCs was improved from 43.5 to 71.0% when combined with CA125.
CONCLUSIONS: High specificity of TFPI2 for preoperative detection of CCC was
verified with the defined cutoff level of TFPI2 in clinical practice. TFPI2 and
CA125 may contribute substantially to precise prediction of intractable CCC.

There are multiple classifications in imaging and surgery of endometriosis and in
this article, we offer a review of the main evaluation systems. The International
Deep Endometriosis Analysis group consensus is the leading document for
ultrasound assessment, while magnetic resonance imaging is guided by the European
Society for Urogenital Radiology recommendations on technical protocol. In
surgery, the revised American Society for Reproductive Medicine classification is
the oldest system, ideally combined with newer classifications, such as Enzian or
Endometriosis Fertility Index. Recently, The World Endometriosis Research
Foundation Endometriosis Phenome and Biobanking Harmonisation Project introduced 
detailed proforma for clinical and intraoperative findings. There is still no
universal consensus, so the initial emphasis should be on the uniform reporting
of the disease extent until research clarifies more the correlations between
extent, symptoms and progression in order to develop a reliable staging
system.Impact StatementWhat is already known on this subject? There have been
several reviews of surgical classifications, comparing their scope and practical 
use, while in the imaging the attempts for literature review has been scarce.What
do the results of this study add? This is the first up to date review offering
detailed analysis of the main classification systems across the three main areas 
involved in endometriosis care - ultrasound, MRI and surgery. The mutual
awareness of the radiological classifications for surgeons and vice versa is
crucial in an efficient multidisciplinary communication and patient care. On
these comparisons we were able to demonstrate the lack of consensus in
description of the extent of the disease and even further lack of prognostic
features (with the exemption of one surgical system).What are the implications of
these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? Future attempts of 
scientific societies should focus on defining uniform nomenclature for extent
description. In the second step the staging classification should encompass
prognostic value (risk of disease and symptoms recurrence).

This study was designed to determine the rates of reoperation following
laparoscopic management of endometriosis, with additional aims to examine
long-term fertility and quality of life outcomes. This is a retrospective study
and a prospective questionnaire of subjects who underwent laparoscopic surgery
for pelvic pain and/or endometriosis from 2010 to 2015. The rate of reoperation
was 8.60%. Following surgery, 83.3% of previously infertile subjects with
endometriosis attempted to conceive with an 80.0% success rate. Subjects had
significant improvement in each quality of life measurement and most sexual
function indices analysed.Impact StatementWhat is already known on this subject? 
Endometriosis is estimated to affect around 35-50% of women experiencing chronic 
pelvic pain and/or infertility. Surgical management of endometriosis is
recommended for patients who desire fertility, are afflicted by a more severe
form of endometriosis, or have had persistent or recurrent pain in spite of
medical management.What the results of this study add? The overall rate of
reoperation for subjects was low at 8.6%. The majority of infertile patients were
able to conceive following surgery.What the implications are of these findings
for clinical practice and/or further research? Laparoscopic management of
endometriosis is an effective management tool with low rates of reoperation and
high efficacy in treating infertility caused by endometriosis.

OBJECTIVE: Inadequate communication about endometriosis symptom burden between
women and healthcare providers is a barrier for optimal treatment. This study
describes the development of the EndoWheel, a patient-reported assessment tool
that visualizes the multi-dimensional burden of endometriosis to facilitate
patient-provider communication.
METHODS: Assessment questions for the tool were developed using an iterative
Delphi consensus process. A consensus phase included additional practitioners and
specialists to broaden perspectives and select revised statements.
Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with 13 women with
endometriosis to assess the scoring and content of the measures.
RESULTS: Symptoms included in the tool were pelvic pain, vaginal bleeding,
bowel/bladder symptoms, energy levels, fertility, impact on activities, emotional
and sexual well-being, and self-perceived global health. Additional life impact
areas included relationships, social and occupational activity, and
self-perception. The 13 interviewees completed the tool in approximately
5-6 minutes (range 4.0-7.5 minutes). Most participants (92%) perceived that the
tool would enable better patient-provider communication, including addressing
symptoms and areas of impact not normally discussed during office visits.
CONCLUSION: Similar to visual circular tools used in burden assessment of other
chronic diseases, the tool may facilitate improved patient dialogue with
providers around endometriosis treatment goals and options.

Endometriosis is a relatively common condition among women, and pancreatic
endometriosis has been reported on rare occasions. Such pancreatic lesions are
difficult to diagnose and distinguish from other cystic lesions of the pancreas
preoperatively. This report describes a case of pancreatic endometriosis in a
51-year-old female patient. Imaging demonstrated an enlarging cyst with findings 
concerning for a mucinous neoplasm. The patient underwent robotic distal
pancreatectomy and splenectomy. Histopathology revealed an endometriotic cyst.
Pancreatic endometriosis can be difficult to distinguish from other lesions of
the pancreas. Surgical resection should be undertaken in cases where malignancy
is suspected.

BACKGROUND: Adenomyosis (AM) and endometriosis (EM) often coexist. Laparoscopic
surgery is one of the main methods for diagnosing and treating these conditions. 
This study aims to investigate the pregnancy outcomes of women with infertility
with both AM and EM after laparoscopic surgery and to identify the relevant
associated factors.
METHODS: This is a retrospective study involving women with infertility diagnosed
with EM and AM. All patients had undergone laparoscopic surgery and were divided 
into two groups according to their pregnancy outcomes. Demographic data,
operation records, and pregnancy outcomes were collected.
RESULTS: A total of 226 female patients with infertility diagnosed with both AM
and EM underwent laparoscopic surgery. Of these, a total of 176 patients
completed follow-up. Ninety-seven patients had live births, including 81
full-term and 16 preterm deliveries. The clinical pregnancy and live birth rates 
were 67.4 and 55.11%, respectively. One hundred thirty-five patients received in 
vitro fertilization (IVF), with 70 (51.85%) of these patients having live births.
Age, endometrioma size, and uterus size were significantly lower in those who had
a successful delivery. There was no statistically significant difference in
symptoms, except that those who achieved live birth had a lower rate of anaemia
(13.40% vs. 25.32%, p = 0.044). The group that did not proceed to have a live
birth had a higher percentage of ovarian and peritoneal endometriosis (p < 0.05),
while the distribution of deep infiltrating endometriosis and adenomyosis types
were similar. Mean uterus diameter (OR: 0.636, 95% CI: 0.434-0.932, p = 0.020)
and endometriosis fertility index (EFI) (OR: 1.299, 95% CI: 1.101-1.531,
p = 0.002) were significantly correlated with live birth in the multivariable
analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Endometriosis and adenomyosis appear to have an adverse effect on
pregnancy outcome. These might be related to the size of the uterus and EFI.
Obstetricians and gynaecologists should be alert to this potential adverse effect
and manage these patients accordingly.

This study aimed to assess the impact of adenomyosis (AD) on different domains of
sexual life. The study population included three groups: one composed of 68 women
diagnosed with AD by transvaginal ultrasound, a second group comprised by 65
women diagnosed with isolated deep infiltrating endometriosis by transvaginal
ultrasound and a third group including 70 women without AD or/and endometriosis. 
All participants completed the Brief Profile of Female Sexual Function (B-PFSF), 
the Female Sexual Distress Scale (FSDS), and the Sexual Quality of Life-Female
(SQOL-F) questionnaire. Compared with non-AD/DIE controls, women with AD present 
significantly lower scores of the B-PFSF and the SQOL-F questionnaires and higher
FSDS questionnaire scores (p < .0001). There were no differences between the
groups of AD and deep infiltrating endometriosis. Clinicians should be aware that
the quality of sexual life may be affected in patients with AD. Early diagnosis
and multidisciplinary management would contribute to preventing impairment of
sexual quality of life in these patients.

BACKGROUND: To present the experience with the surgical management of ureteral
endometriosis (UE) in our single center.
METHODS: To present the experience with the surgical management of ureteral
endometriosis (UE) in our single center. A retrospective analysis of 40 patients 
with UE who presented with intraoperative surgical findings of endometriosis
involving the ureter and pathology-proven UE was performed.
RESULTS: Forty patients (median age, 42.5 years) with histological evidence of UE
were included. Six (15%) patients had a history of endometriosis. Twenty-one
(52%) patients had urological symptoms, and 19 (48%) patients were asymptomatic. 
All patients had hydronephrosis. The mean glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of the
ipsilateral kidney was significantly worse than that of the contralateral kidney 
(23.4 vs 54.9 ml/min; P < 0.001). Twelve (30%) patients were treated with
ureteroureterostomy (11 open approaches and 1 robotic approach). Twenty-two (55%)
patients underwent ureteroneocystostomy (17 open approaches, 4 laparoscopic
approaches and 1 robotic approach). Five patients underwent nephroureterectomy.
One patient refused aggressive surgery and received ureteroscopic biopsy and
ureteral stent placement. Thirteen (33%) patients required gynecological
operations. Three (8%) patients in the open group suffered from major surgical
complications. Nine (24%) patients received postoperative endocrine therapy.
Twenty-eight (70%) patients were followed up (median follow-up time, 71 months). 
Twenty-four patients received kidney-sparing surgeries. The success rate for
these 24 patients was 21/24 (87.5%). The success rates of ureteroneocystostomy
and ureteroureterostomy were 15/16 (93.8%) and 5/7 (71.4%), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Although UE is rare, we should remain vigilant for the disease among
female patients with silent hydronephrosis. Typically, a multidisciplinary
surgical team is necessary. For patients with severe UE, segmental ureteral
resection with ureteroureterostomy (UU) or ureteroneocystostomy may be a
preferred choice.

OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this study is to investigate whether there are any 
minor sonographic uterine findings, not typical for adenomyosis, in endometriosis
patients. The secondary objective is to determine the prevalence of sonographic
features of adenomyosis in an infertile population with endometriosis.
STUDY DESIGN: The investigation was of 291 infertile women with endometriosis,
either manifesting endometrioma (OMA) or diagnosed through laparoscopy, who were 
investigated for two-dimensional transvaginal sonographic (2D-TVS) features of
adenomyosis. These patients were grouped as either having endometriosis with
adenomyosis (EwA,n = 121) or without adenomyosis (EwoA, n = 170). Additionally,
patients without both endometriosis and 2D-TVS features of adenomyosis
constituted the control group (n = 170).
RESULTS: At least one 2D-TVS feature of adenomyosis was detected in 41.6 % (n =
121) of women with endometriosis. Asymmetrical myometrial thickening of uterine
walls (57.9 %), hyperechogenic islands (47.1 %), and fan-shaped shadowing (46.9
%) were relatively more prevalent 2D-TVS findings among EwA patients. Multiple
OMA (p = 0.038), OMA ≥ 4 cm (p = 0.034), and total OMA volumes were found to be
higher (p = 0.004) in the EwA group. Additionally, uterine volumes were found to 
be 96.7 cm3, 73.0 cm3, and 64.2 cm3 in the EwA, EwoA, and control groups,
respectively (EwA vs EwoA, p < 0.001; EwoA vs control, p <0.001). Multivariate
linear regression analysis revealed that the presence of endometriosis was
independently associated with an increase in uterine volume (β = 0.243, p <
0.001).
CONCLUSION: A stepwise and statistically significant volume increase from the
control group to the EwoA and then to the EwA group may reflect a spectrum of
uterine involvement in endometriosis. This might indicate that many uterine
endometriosis cases are still hidden from view, possibly demonstrating an
"iceberg phenomenon".

INTRODUCTION: Endometriosis is challenging to treat. It is a painful and chronic 
inflammatory disorder that impacts up to 10% of reproductive-aged women. Despite 
available surgical and medical treatment options, recurrence of symptoms is
common. Available studies suggest that exercise may have a therapeutic effect on 
chronic inflammation and thereby on pain perception. This review evaluates if
exercise can decrease pain perception in symptomatic endometriosis patients.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This systematic review was conducted according to PRISMA by
searching databases Medline and Embase to locate randomized controlled trial and 
observational studies. Risk of bias was investigated using the Cochrane
Collaboration Tool for the Evaluation of Randomized Controlled Trials and the
ROBINS-I quality assessment scale. Inclusion criteria were women of reproductive 
age, laparoscopically confirmed diagnosis of endometriosis and intervention of
any type of exercise. All manuscripts were evaluated by two of the authors and in
doubt a third author was consulted. This review was registered to Prospero on 14 
November 2020 (CRD42020212309).
RESULTS: Six articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included in this 
systematic review. Concerning exercise, two studies showed significant decrease
in pain relief while the remaining studies showed either negative or no impact on
pain relief. A meta-analysis could not be conducted due to considerable
heterogeneity amongst the included studies.
CONCLUSIONS: The present review does not indicate any beneficial effect of
exercise on pain in women with endometriosis. Thus, there is a need for
randomized controlled trials with correct power calculation, well-defined study
groups and training programs to be able to answer the question of whether
exercise can improve the pain experience in patients with endometriosis.

INTRODUCTION: Robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery (RALS) has gained widespread 
application in several surgical specialties. Previous studies on the feasibility 
and safety of RALS versus standard laparoscopy (S-LPS) for rectosigmoid
endometriosis are limited and reported conflicting data. This study aims to
compare S-LPS and RALS in patients with rectosigmoid endometriosis in terms of
perioperative surgical and clinical data.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This is a multicentric, observational, prospective cohort
study including 44 patients affected by rectosigmoid endometriosis referred to
two tertiary referral centers for endometriosis from September 2018 to September 
2019. Patients were divided into two groups: twenty-two patients underwent S-LPS,
and 22 RALS. Our primary outcome was to compare operative time (from skin
incision to suture) between the two groups. Secondary outcomes included:
operative room time (patient entry in operative room and patient out), estimated 
blood loss, laparotomic conversion rate, length of hospital stay, perioperative
complications, and evaluation of endometriosis-related symptoms at 12-month
follow-up.
RESULTS: The two groups were comparable regarding preoperative and surgical data,
except for higher rates of hysterectomies and bilateral uterosacral ligament
removal procedures in the RALS group. Also after adjusting for these
discrepancies, operative time was similar between S-LPS and RALS. Operative room 
time was statistically longer in RALS group compared to that of S-LPS. No
statistically significant difference was found concerning other study outcomes.
Pain and bowel symptoms improved in both groups at 12-month follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: If performed by expert teams, RALS provides similar perioperative
outcomes compared to S-LPS in rectosigmoid endometriosis surgical treatment,
except for longer operative room time.

BACKGROUND: Severe endometriosis with rectal involvement requires careful
pre-operative investigation and planning. Methodical history taking and
pre-operative discussion with the patient is key to establishing their wishes,
aims, and expected outcomes of treatment options. Even with extensive prior
investigation, the optimal surgical management can not always be determined until
the time of laparoscopy.
SETTING: Multidisciplinary team at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital
Endometriosis Centre, London. Surgery carried out at the Lister Hospital,
Chelsea.
VIDEO: We present the case of a 31 year old patient with rectovaginal
endometriosis, her pre-operative workup and laparoscopy with description of the
steps and decision making leading to a laparoscopic segmental bowel resection
with anastomosis. We demonstrate a systematic assessment of findings at
laparoscopy, decision making prior to undertaking a segmental bowel resection,
and the techniques employed in full excision of her endometriosis by a joint team
of gynaecologists and colorectal surgeons. The steps involve: bilateral
ureterolysis and pelvic sidewall dissection; ovarian suspension; adhesiolysis;
pararectal space dissection, and segmental bowel resection with anastomosis. We
describe the surgical technique and anatomical landmarks at each step by both the
gynaecology and colorectal teams including post operative sigmoidoscopy and leak 
test.
CONCLUSIONS: Clear understanding of the patients' objectives are paramount prior 
to any surgery for endometriosis where, even with extensive investigation, the
optimal surgical management is not always certain. A systematic assessment of
anatomy and pathology combined an understanding surgical technique ensures a good
outcome and patient satisfaction.

AIM: To evaluate the frequency of complications and factors associated with the
recurrence of endometriosis in women with deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE)
undergoing surgical treatment.
METHODS: A retrospective observational cohort study with 72 women who underwent
surgery and followed up by DIE at the University of Campinas from 2007 to 2017.
The variables analyzed were clinical characteristics, use and type of drug
treatment before and after surgery, operative time and complications inherent to 
the procedure, as well as the recurrence of lesions on imaging.
RESULTS: The mean age of women was 39.7 ± 6.3 years and the mean follow-up was
4.56 ± 2.60 years. Complications were reported in 16.6% of surgeries and
recurrence of lesions in 34.7%. The risk of intraoperative complications was
higher in the presence of lesions of the bowel and in those who used
intramuscular progestin before surgery. A higher risk of recurrence was observed 
among those who did not use hormonal treatment or used a levonorgestrel-releasing
intrauterine device (LNG-IUD) in the postoperative period.
CONCLUSION: Women with DIE have a high rate of complications during surgical
treatment and a higher risk of recurrence when they did not receive hormonal
treatment or when treated with LNG-IUD after surgery.

OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in restrictions and social
isolation measures, which carry mental health risks. Cancellation of surgery and 
appointments, medication shortages and fear of the virus itself may have further 
challenged wellbeing. We aimed to understand how COVID-19 has affected people
with endometriosis.
METHODS: Using a mixed methods design, we examined; 1) the impact of COVID-19 on 
endometriosis related healthcare, symptoms and functioning; and 2) the
relationship between a measure of fear of COVID-19 and qualitative impact in 162 
women with endometriosis.
RESULTS: We found that 60% of women reported impact of the pandemic upon
healthcare, with sub-themes documenting the difficulty of cancelled and delayed
treatment, specific COVID-19 barriers, and the advantages and disadvantages of
telehealth. Only 23% reported negative impact on symptoms, specifically stress;
76% reported impact on daily functioning, with sub-themes related to compromised 
work, social life and healthy living. A 'hidden benefits' theme revealed ways
that COVID-19 had improved some women's lives, including working from home, and
the opportunity for healthy lifestyle choices. Logistic regressions revealed that
fear of COVID-19 significantly predicted impact themes (healthcare odds
ratio = 0.93, 95% confidence interval: 0.87-0.98; symptoms odds ratio = 0.88, 95%
confidence interval: 0.82-0.95; functioning odds ratio = 0.92, 95% confidence
interval: 0.85-0.99).
CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate the need to provide patients with supportive
care during pandemic restrictions that leverage self-management strategies.

RESEARCH QUESTION: Does ferroptosis resistance occur in patients with
endometriosis, and can it be used as an indicator for diagnosis?
DESIGN: Six datasets including 164 expression arrays from endometriosis studies
were selected from the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene
Expression Omnibus. Surrogate variable analysis was used for data integration
after RobustRankAggreg to determine ferroptosis-associated gene expression
trends. Differential genes between eutopic and normal endometrium, as well as
between ectopic and eutopic endometrium, were determined. Ferroptosis resistance 
mechanisms during the development of endometriosis were determined by intergenic 
co-expression and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway.
Independent factors were then screened by least absolute shrinkage and selection 
operator regression to build a nomogram diagnostic model. The Hosmer-Lemeshow
test and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were used to verify model 
consistency and diagnostic efficacy, respectively.
RESULTS: Differential analysis revealed a progressive increase in changes of
ferroptosis-related genes in endometriosis patients during the process of
endometrium development from eutopic to ectopic. In the subsequent regression
selection, nine ferroptosis-associated genes in the eutopic endometrium could, in
most cases, distinguish endometriosis patients from healthy patients. Therefore, 
these genes can be used as independent factors for endometriosis diagnosis. The
nomogram model established by these molecular markers had an area under the ROC
curve of 0.979.
CONCLUSIONS: The eutopic and ectopic endometrium of patients with endometriosis
is associated with ferroptosis resistance genetic alterations.
Ferroptosis-associated genes have excellent clinical value in endometriosis
diagnosis, achieved by the nomogram model.

STUDY OBJECTIVE: Assess postoperative management of pediatric patients with
benign ovarian neoplasms to develop recommendations for postoperative care.
DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study.
SETTING: Eight pediatric hospitals in the Midwest.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients up to 21 years of age who underwent surgery for a benign
ovarian neoplasm between January 2010 and December 2016 were included.
INTERVENTIONS: No prospective interventions were evaluated.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Included postoperative imaging findings, recurrence rates,
reoperation rates, and the timing of aforementioned results.
RESULTS: 427 patients met inclusion criteria. After the index surgery, 155 (36%) 
patients had a routine imaging study. Among those with routine imaging,
abnormalities were noted in 48 patients (31%); 7 went on to have reoperation
(5%), and no malignant pathologies or torsion were identified. Excluding the 7
patients that went on to have a reoperation as a result of routine imaging, 113
patients developed symptoms postoperatively and underwent imaging as a result
(27%, 113/420). Abnormalities were noted in 44 (10%), and 15 underwent
reoperation (4%), among them two malignancies and three cases of torsion. Of
these 44 patients, 23 had initially undergone routine imaging and subsequently
went on to have symptomatic imaging, with 17% (4/23) undergoing reoperation.
CONCLUSIONS: Routine imaging did not identify malignancy; most lesions identified
on routine imaging were incidental findings. While not powered to appreciate a
statistically significant difference, patients with malignancy or torsion were
identified in the symptomatic group. This suggests no benefit from routine
imaging and supports symptomatic imaging post-operatively to minimize costs and
patient/family burden.

Malignant transformation of endometriosis is rare, and most cases concern the
ovaries, while extraovarian cases are mostly found in the rectovaginal septum.
Incisional adenocarcinoma is extremely rare, with only few cases reported in the 
literature, while their molecular profile remains unknown. Thus, we report on an 
abdominal wall cesarean section scar endometrioid adenocarcinoma studied by
next-generation sequencing and microsatellite instability analysis.

It is suggested that aberrantly expressed microRNAs are involved in the
pathogenesis of endometriosis. Our previous study demonstrated that expression of
the microRNA hsa-miR-199a-3p is attenuated in human endometriotic cyst stromal
cells (ECSCs). The current study aimed to define the roles of hsa-miR-199a-3p in 
the development of endometriosis. ECSCs and normal endometrial stromal cells
(NESCs) were isolated from ovarian endometrioma and normal endometrial tissues,
respectively. We evaluated the effect of transfected hsa-miR-199a-3p on the
migration, invasion, and contractility of ECSCs using Transwell migration assays,
in vitro wound healing assays, Transwell invasion assays, and collagen gel
contraction assays. We also examined the downstream target of hsa-miR-199a-3p
with an online public database search and luciferase reporter assay. Expression
of hsa-miR-199a-3p in ECSCs was significantly lower than that in NESCs, whereas
the expression of p21-activated kinase 4 (PAK4) mRNA was significantly higher.
Transfection of hsa-miR-199a-3p inhibited the migration, invasion, and
contractility of ECSCs via inhibition of PAK4 mRNA expression. PAK4 was confirmed
to be the direct target of hsa-miR-199a-3p. Transfection of PAK4 small
interfering RNA and the PAK4 inhibitor PF-3758309 also inhibited ECSC migration, 
invasion, and contractility. These findings suggest that hsa-miR-199a-3p may act 
as a tumor suppressor in endometriosis development. Attenuation of
hsa-miR-199a-3p expression was favorable for ECSCs to acquire the highly
invasive, motile, and contractile characteristics of endometriotic cells and is
involved in the development of endometriosis. Accordingly, PAK4 inhibitors may be
promising for the treatment of endometriosis.

PURPOSE: Endometriosis is a common chronic gynecological disease greatly
affecting women health. Prior studies have implicated that dysferlin (DYSF)
aberration might be involved in the pathogenesis of ovarian endometriosis. In the
present study, we explore the potential presence of DYSF mutations in a total of 
152 Han Chinese samples with ovarian endometriosis.
METHODS: We analyze the potential presence of DYSF mutations by direct DNA
sequencing.
RESULTS: A total of seven rare variants/mutations in the DYSF gene in 10 out of
152 samples (6.6%) were identified, including 5 rare variants and 2 novel
mutations. For the 5 rare variants, p.R334W and p.G941S existed in 2 samples,
p.R865W, p.R1173H and p.G1531S existed in single sample, respectively; for the
two novel mutations, p.W352* and p.I1642F, they were identified in three
patients. These rare variants/mutations were absent or existed at extremely low
frequency either in our 1006 local control women without endometriosis, or in the
China Metabolic Analytics Project (ChinaMAP) and Genome Aggregation Database
(gnomAD) databases. Evolutionary conservation analysis results suggested that all
of these rare variants/mutations were evolutionarily conserved among 11
vertebrate species from Human to Fox. Furthermore, in silico analysis results
suggested these rare variants/mutations were disease-causing. Nevertheless, we
find no significant association between DYSF rare variants/mutations and the
clinical features in our patients. To our knowledge, this is the first report
revealing frequent DYSF mutations in ovarian endometriosis.
CONCLUSION: We identified a high frequency of DYSF rare variants/mutations in
ovarian endometriosis for the first time. This study suggests a new correlation
between DYSF rare variants/mutations and ovarian endometriosis, implicating DYSF 
rare variants/mutations might be positively involved in the pathogenesis of
ovarian endometriosis.

Endometriosis is an estrogen-dependent gynecological disease primarily affecting 
women of childbearing age, which gives rise to pelvic pain calling for multiple
operations, and sometimes leading to infertility. However, the etiology of
endometriosis remains poorly understood. In this study we investigated the roles 
of two Ubiquitin E3 Ligases, namely hsc70-interacting protein (CHIP) and mouse
double minute 2 (MDM2), in the abnormal estrogenic activity in endometriosis. We 
first collected endometrial tissues from 91 cases of endometriosis and 78 cases
of uterine myomas. Next, we established a murine endometriosis model by ectopic
endometrial tissue implantation. In other studies, we isolated human endometrial 
stromal cells (HESCs) were isolated from the endometrial tissues, and performed
HA- or FLAG-immunoprecipitation assays and immunoblotting with an anti-ubiquitin 
antibody to test the interactions among BAG2, CHIP, MDM2, estrogen receptor α
(ERα), and ERβ. The expression of ERα was downregulated while that of ERβ, BAG2, 
and MDM2 was upregulated in human endometriosis and in the mouse model. CHIP
degraded ERβ instead of ERα via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, while BAG2
impaired the CHIP-mediated degradation of ERβ in cultured HESCs derived from
human endometriosis. The degradation of ERα by MDM2 in cultured
endometriosis-HESCs also occurred through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.
Knockdown of both BAG2 and MDM2 alleviated the development of endometriosis in
mice. Our findings suggest that the interference of BAG2 and MDM2 may have
therapeutic effects in endometriosis. Understanding better the molecular
mechanisms underlying the regulation of the abnormal estrogenic activity in
endometriosis is crucial for the advancement of targeted therapeutic strategies.

Obesity and endometriosis are two very common entities, yet there is uncertainty 
on their exact relationship. Observational studies have repeatedly shown an
inverse correlation between endometriosis and a low body mass index (BMI).
However, obesity does not protect against endometriosis and on the contrary an
increased BMI may lead to more severe forms of the disease. Besides, BMI is not
accurate in all cases of obesity. Consequently, other anthropometric and phenomic
traits have been studied, including body adiposity content, as well as the effect
of BMI early in life on the manifestation of endometriosis in adulthood. Some
studies have shown that the phenotypic inverse correlation between the two
entities has a genetic background; however, others have indicated that certain
polymorphisms are linked with endometriosis in females with increased BMI. The
advent of metabolic bariatric surgery and pertinent research have led to the
emergence of biomolecules that may be pivotal in understanding the
pathophysiological interaction of the two entities, especially in the context of 
angiogenesis and inflammation. Future research should focus on three objectives: 
detection and interpretation of obesity-related biomarkers in experimental models
with endometriosis; integration of endometriosis-related queries into bariatric
registries; and multidisciplinary approach and collaboration among specialists.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to provide an overview of the extent to which women
with endometriosis are informed about, interested in, and make use of CAM, and to
evaluate which of the methods are most often applied.
STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective, two-center cohort study was conducted using a
validated questionnaire among women with laparoscopically confirmed endometriosis
at two urban teaching hospitals, certified as endometriosis centres.
RESULTS: A total of 592 patients were included in the study and received the
questionnaire; 114 (19.3 %) were included in the data analysis. Most of the women
were not receiving hormone therapy at the time of the study (n = 60, 52.6 %).
Most (n = 75, 65.8 %) were interested in CAM, but only a minority (n = 12, 10.5
%) had detailed knowledge about it. A total of 81 patients (71.1 %) had used at
least one CAM method for disease management; the five most frequently used CAM
methods were exercise (n = 55, 48.2 %), vitamins (n = 40, 35.1 %), yoga (n = 38, 
33.3 %), homeopathy (n = 32, 28.1 %), and trace elements (n = 27, 23.7 %).
CONCLUSIONS: In our study population, women with endometriosis are strongly
interested in using CAM, but have only limited information about it.
Nevertheless, a majority of the patients had used at least one CAM method to
relieve symptoms associated with the disease and the most often used was
exercise.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of endometriosis and peritoneal pockets and
to analyze whether these pockets are associated with pain.
METHODS: Analysis of prospectively registered data of all women undergoing
laparoscopy for infertility or pelvic pain between 1988 and 2011 at KU Leuven
University Hospital.
RESULTS: Of 4497 women, 191 had 238 pockets, with a prevalence of 4.7% in women
with infertility only, 4.9% in women with infertility and pelvic pain, and 3.5%
in women with pelvic pain only (P = 0.045 for all infertility vs. pelvic pain
only). Prevalence did not vary by age. Pockets were associated with endometriosis
(P < 0.0001), which was found in 77% of women with pockets. Among women with
infertility only, the prevalence of endometriosis was higher in women with
pockets (P = 0.0001) than in women without. The prevalence of endometriosis was
similar in women with infertility and pelvic pain or pelvic pain only. Pelvic
pain as an indication for surgery was associated simultaneously (through logistic
regression) with endometriosis (P < 0.0001) and pockets (P = 0.040). Pelvic pain 
severity was associated simultaneously with pockets (P = 0.0026) and the severity
of subtle (P = 0.001), typical (P = 0.030), cystic ovarian (P = 0.051), and deep 
endometriosis (P < 0.0001). Pelvic pain severity was not associated with
endometriosis in the pockets or the diameter or location of pockets.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of pockets was low, at between 3.5% and 5%. Women
with infertility only and pockets had more endometriosis than women without.
Severe pelvic pain and pelvic pain as an indication for surgery were associated
with the presence of pockets as well as the presence and severity of
endometriosis.

STUDY OBJECTIVE: We performed a long-term follow-up to quantify the impairment of
sexual quality of life (SQL) and health-related quality of life (HRQL) in
sexually active women following laparoscopic excision of deep infiltrating
endometriosis (DIE).
DESIGN: Prospective case-control study.
SETTING: Hospital Clinic of Barcelona.
PATIENTS: 200 patients were divided into two groups: 129 premenopausal women with
DIE (DIE group) and 64 healthy women who underwent tubal ligation (C group).
INTERVENTIONS: All patients underwent laparoscopic surgery: laparoscopic
endometriosis surgery in the DIE group and laparoscopic tubal ligation in the C
group. All women were followed for at least 36 months and answered the Medical
Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form (SF-36) questionnaire to assess their HRQL and 
3 self-administered questionnaires that evaluate different aspects of SQL: the
generic Sexual Quality of Life-Female (SQOL-F), the Female Sexual Distress Scale 
(FSDS) to evaluate "sexually related distress" and The Brief Profile of Female
Sexual Function (B-PFSF) to screen hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD). DIE 
patients and controls answered the four questionnaires before surgery and DIE
patients also completed the questionnaires at 6 and 36 months after surgery.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Comparison of patients and controls before surgery
showed a statistically significant impairment of SQL and HRQL among DIE patients.
Statistically significant improvement of SQL and HRQL was observed in the DIE
group six months after surgery, achieving similar scores to the C group.
Evaluation 36 months after surgery showed better SQL and HRQL compared with
presurgical SQL in the DIE group, with a slight reduction compared with the
6-month evaluation.
CONCLUSION: SQL and HRQL improved in DIE patients undergoing complete
laparoscopic endometriosis resection and were comparable to healthy women at 6
months after surgery, showing a slight reduction at 36 months of follow-up.

Persistent pelvic pain (PPP) is an important cause of psychological distress and 
productivity loss in women. In 2017, a multidisciplinary clinic was established
to care for Queensland women with PPP. By analysing clinic and emergency
department data, we found 19% fewer patients required any presentation to the
emergency department for exacerbations of pelvic pain (P = 0.003) within 12
months of clinic attendance. There was also a reduction in number of
presentations, short stay admissions and daily opiate use in regular users. The
Persistent Pelvic Pain Clinic (PPPC) made a difference to these women and reduced
resource burden on a busy emergency department.

The diagnosis of thoracic endometriosis (TE) is challenging, hence resulting in
under-diagnosis as well as long delays before arriving at a correct definitive
diagnosis. Our aim is to review the histopathological findings in TE, summarise
the diagnostic features, identify any major histo-morphological indicator(s)
hitherto unrecognised as such, suggest diagnostic criteria; all with the aim of
improving the diagnostic capacity and reducing observer error even where the
clinical suspicion is low. A case-control study in which a search in the
pathology archives of a referral hospital over a 10-year period was conducted.
Twenty-six cases of TE were identified, reviewed, and compared with a control
population of 48 cases taken from common benign thoracic diseases. Nine notable
histological features were identified in varying permutations in the test group, 
namely: endometrioid glands, lymphoid clusters, ceroid macrophages, siderophages,
cholesterol crystals, capillary congestion, multinucleated giant cells, smooth
muscle bundles and fibrosis. The first 6 features were frequent; each being
present in over 13 (13/26; 50%) test cases. The first 8 features showed
significant association with TE by the Chi-squared test (P<0.05). In this group, 
the strength of association is high for the first 4 features (Cramér's V≥0.5).
The presence of ceroid macrophages is shown to be a novel key feature, previously
unrecognised as such, for the identification of TE. The presence of any three of 
four features including endometrioid glands, lymphoid clusters, ceroid
macrophages and siderophages is a suggested criterion for the definitive
diagnosis of TE.

BACKGROUND: Hydrocele of canal of Nuck (HCN) is a rare disease in adult female.
The diagnosis and treatment of HCN is still a challenge for surgeons.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 56-year-old female presented with recent onset of occasional
pain during exercise and an asymptomatic left groin swelling. Ultrasonography
results were suspicious for left inguinal hernia incarceration and computed
tomography (CT) scan showed no intestinal obstruction, which was considered as
HCN. Laparoscopic hydrocelectomy of the HCN and a routine laparoscopic hernia
repair via the transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) approach were performed.
Postoperative pathology showed no malignant lesions or endometriosis.
CONCLUSIONS: The preoperative diagnosis of HCN is extremely important. Surgeons
should choose appropriate surgical methods for different anatomical HCNs based on
the preoperative diagnosis.

Endometriosis is characterised by inflammation and fibrotic changes. Our previous
study using a mouse model showed that proinflammatory factors present in
peritoneal hemorrhage exacerbated inflammation in endometriosis-like grafts, at
least in part through the activation of prostaglandin (PG) E2 receptor and
protease-activated receptor (PAR). In addition, hypoxia is a well-known inducer
of fibrosis that may be associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). 
However, the complex molecular interactions between hypoxia and proinflammatory
menstruation-related factors, PGE2 and thrombin, a PAR1 agonist, on EMT in
endometriosis have not been fully characterised. To explore the effects of
hypoxia and proinflammatory factors on EMT-like changes in endometrial cells, we 
determined the effects of PGE2 and thrombin (P/T) on EMT marker expression and
cell migration in three dimensional cultured human endometrial epithelial (EECs) 
and stromal (ESCs) cells. Treatment of EECs with P/T under hypoxia stimulated
cell migration, increased the expression of mesenchymal N-cadherin, vimentin and 
C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4), and reduced the expression of epithelial
E-cadherin. Furthermore, treatment with C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12),
a ligand for CXCR4, increased EMT marker expression and cell migration. In ESCs, 
P/T or estrogen treatment under hypoxic conditions increased the expression and
secretion of CXCL12. Taken together, our data show that hypoxic and
proinflammatory stimuli induce EMT, cell migration and inflammation in EECs,
which was increased by CXCL12 derived from ESCs. These data imply that
inflammatory mediators in retrograde menstrual fluid contribute to ectopic
endometrial EMT and migration in the presence of peritoneal hypoxia.

Dyspareunia is recurrent or persistent pain with sexual intercourse that causes
distress. It affects approximately 10% to 20% of U.S. women. Dyspareunia may be
superficial, causing pain with attempted vaginal insertion, or deep. Women with
sexual pain are at increased risk of sexual dysfunction, relationship distress,
diminished quality of life, anxiety, and depression. Because discussing sexual
issues may be uncomfortable, clinicians should create a safe and welcoming
environment when taking a sexual history, where patients describe the
characteristics of the pain (e.g., location, intensity, duration). Physical
examination of the external genitalia includes visual inspection and sequential
pressure with a cotton swab, assessing for focal erythema or pain. A single-digit
vaginal examination may identify tender pelvic floor muscles, and a bimanual
examination can assess for uterine retroversion and pelvic masses. Common
diagnoses include vulvodynia, inadequate lubrication, vaginal atrophy, postpartum
causes, pelvic floor dysfunction, endometriosis, and vaginismus. Treatment is
focused on the cause and may include lubricants, pelvic floor physical therapy,
topical analgesics, vaginal estrogen, cognitive behavior therapy, vaginal
dilators, modified vestibulectomy, or onabotulinumtoxinA injections.

BACKGROUND: Dysregulation of immune response is associated with development of
endometriosis. The study aim was to evaluate effect of combined oral
contraceptive pills (COCs) consisting of ethinyl estradiol (EE) and desogestrel
on the expression of macrophage, natural killer cells, and regulatory T cells of 
ovarian endometriotic cysts.
METHODS: Endometriotic cyst wall tissues were collected from women with
endometriosis who were treated (n = 22) with COCs (one table per day of EE
0.03 mg and desogestrel 0.15 mg administered for 28 to 35 days before surgery) or
untreated (n = 22). The tissues were collected from endometriotic cyst wall
during laparoscopic or laparotomy ovarian cystectomy. Immunohistochemistry for
anti-CD68, anti-CD56, and anti-forkhead-winged helix transcription factor
(FoxP3), a marker for macrophages, natural killer cells, and regulatory T cells, 
respectively, were investigated.
RESULTS: The median (interquartile range [IQR]) number of anti-CD68 positive
cells in the COC group was significantly lower than in the untreated group (12.7;
4.9-19.3) versus 45.7 (26.0-70.7), p < 0.001). Tissue infiltration of anti-CD56
positive cells in endometriotic cyst was significantly higher after the treatment
when compared with tissue from untreated group (42.9, 27.4-68.9 versus 25.3
(14.1-37.3; p = 0.009). The number of regulatory T cells was also significantly
increased in the COC group (6.3, 2.8-15.5) versus 0 (0-1.8; p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The effects of COC, containing EE 0.30 mg with desogestrel 0.15 mg, 
on the immune system was demonstrated by a significant decrease in the number of 
macrophages and an increase in natural killer and regulatory T cells.

INTRODUCTION: The Endometriosis Fertility Index (EFI) is a validated score for
predicting the postoperative spontaneous pregnancy rate in patients undergoing
endometriosis surgery. However, the practical use of the EFI to advise patients
about postoperative fertility management is unclear.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients participating in the ENDOQUAL study-a
prospective observational bi-center cohort study conducted between 01/2012 and
06/2018-who underwent surgery for infertility were asked to complete a
questionnaire collecting time and mode of conception. Statistical analysis was
performed with the Fine and Gray model of competing risks and analysis of
fertility according to the EFI.
RESULTS: Of the 234 patients analyzed, 104 (44.4%) conceived postoperatively
including 58 (55.8%) spontaneous pregnancies. An EFI of 0-4 for spontaneous
pregnancies was associated with a lower cumulative pregnancy incidence compared
to an EFI of 5-10 (52 versus 34 pregnancies respectively, Subdistribution Hazard 
Ratio (SHR) = 0.47; 95% CI [0.2; 1.1]; p = 0.08). An EFI of 0-4 was associated
with a higher cumulative pregnancy rate for pregnancies obtained by artificial
reproduction technology (ART), compared to an EFI of 5-10 (12 versus 6
pregnancies respectively, SHR = 1.9; CI95% [0.96; 3.8]; p = 0.06). Fecundability 
decreased from 12 months for EFI 0-4 and from 24 months for EFI 5-10.
CONCLUSION: Our analysis suggests that patients with an unfavorable EFI (≤4) have
more ART pregnancies than patients with a favorable EFI (≥5) and should be
referred for ART shortly after surgery. Patients with a favorable EFI may attempt
spontaneous pregnancy for 24 months before referral.

Endometriosis and pelvic pain are associated. However, only half of the subtle
and typical, and not all cystic and deep lesions are painful. The mechanism of
the pain is explained by cyclical trauma and repair, an inflammatory reaction,
activation of nociceptors up to 2.7 cm distance, painful adhesions and neural
infiltration. The relationship between the severity of lesions and pain is
variable. Diagnosis of the many causes requires laparoscopy and expertise.
Imaging cannot exclude endometriosis. Surgical removal is the treatment of
choice. Medical therapy without a diagnosis risks missing pathology and
chronification of pain if not 100% effective. Indications and techniques of
surgery are described as expert opinion since randomised controlled trials were
not performed for ethical reasons, since not suited for multimorbidity while a
control group is poorly accepted. Subtle endometriosis needs destruction since
some cause pain or progress to more severe disease. Typical lesions need excision
or vaporisation since depth can be misjudged by inspection. Painful cystic
ovarian endometriosis needs adhesiolysis and either destruction of the lining or 
excision of the cyst wall, taking care to avoid ovarian damage. Cysts larger than
6cm need a 2 step technique or an ovariectomy. Excision of deep endometriosis is 
difficult and complication prone surgery involving bladder, ureter, and bowel
surgery varying from excision and suturing, disc excision with a circular stapler
and resection anastomosis. Completeness of excision, prevention of postoperative 
adhesions and recurrences of endometriosis, and the indication to explore large
somatic nerves will be discussed.

Uterine artery pseudoaneurysm (UAP) is a rare complication during pregnancy that 
can cause serious consequences in both the pregnant woman and the fetus. Herein, 
we have described the cases of two pregnant women with UAP. Both patients had a
history of laparoscopy for management of endometrioid ovarian cysts. Neither
patient was operated in the retroperitoneum or around the uterine vessels. UAP
was diagnosed by Doppler ultrasonography and confirmed by magnetic resonance
imaging. Due to exacerbation of hypogastric pain, the first patient was treated
shortly after admission to the hospital at the 23rd week of gestation by
endovascular intervention with occlusion of the UAP using microcoils. The
patient's complaints resolved immediately, and a healthy baby was delivered via
planned Cesarean section at the 38th gestational week. In the second case with
twin pregnancy, angiography was performed at the 27th gestational week; however, 
the feeding vessel of the UAP could not be identified. The patient was followed
up at weekly intervals, and due to increasing left hypogastric pain, cesarean
section was performed at the 33rd gestational week. During surgery, the left
internal iliac artery was ligated and the entire pseudoaneurysm was successfully 
removed. Both women gave birth to healthy neonates; however, the therapeutic
approaches were distinct in both cases. As the previous laparoscopic surgeries in
both patients were performed only in the adnexal area, and not around the uterine
arteries in the parametria, the endometrial decidual reaction could have caused
the UAPs in the described cases.

Catamenial haemoptysis, the expectoration of blood during menses, has not been
extensively reported in the cystic fibrosis (CF) literature. We describe four
cases (age range: 25-34 years) of catamenial haemoptysis across four CF centres
in the United States. These cases may represent thoracic endometriosis versus
hormonal fluctuations in airway inflammation or infection resulting in bronchial 
artery bleeding. We identify common and nuanced management strategies including
use of pro-coagulants, hormone contraceptives, anti-inflammatories, bronchial
artery embolization, and use of the newer cystic fibrosis transmembrane
conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators.

AIM: Study the effect of low-dose aspirin on the endometrial receptivity in
endometriosis rat models.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study is to explore the expressions of progesterone
receptor and LIF among three groups of endometriosis rat models: control group
(n = 12), EMs group (n = 15), and aspirin group (n = 17). The expressions of
progesterone receptor (PR), PRA, PRB, and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor
(LIFR) in eutopic endometrium were determined using immunohistochemistry
technology, western blot, and qRT-PCR. The levels of LIF in eutopic endometrium
and serum were detected by western blot, qRT-PCR, and ELISA.
RESULTS: The expressions of PR, PRA, and PRB protein were significantly increased
in the eutopic endometrium after low-dose aspirin treatment, and the level of PRB
mRNA was also increased while the ratio of PRA/PRB mRNA was decreased in the
eutopic endometrium. The levels of LIF in eutopic endometrium and serum were
increased compared with the untreated endometriosis rats. However, the expression
of LIFR was not statistically different among the three groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that the low-dose aspirin treatment could
downregulate progesterone resistance and increase the expression of LIF of
endometriosis rats during the implantation window, which could improve
endometrial receptivity and enhance the pregnant rate of endometriosis. It may
provide a potential treatment method for endometriosis-related infertility.

BACKGROUND: Endometriosis is defined as the presence of endometrial tissue
outside the uterine cavity. This chronic and recurring condition occurs in women 
of reproductive age. It is a common cause of pain or infertility and can cause
non-specific symptoms such as lower back pain, dyspareunia (pain during or after 
intercourse), and dysmenorrhoea (menstrual pain). Endometriosis is an
oestrogen-dependent disease. Medical treatment aims to relieve symptoms and
shrink lesions by suppressing the normal menstrual cycle. In this review, we
consider medication specifically aiming to modulate oestrogen receptors as an
alternative method of treatment.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of selective oestrogen
receptor modulators (SERMs) in the management of endometriosis.
SEARCH METHODS: We searched for trials in the following databases (from their
inception to 28 May 2020): Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised
Register, Cochrane Central Register of Studies (CRS Online), MEDLINE, Embase,
CINAHL, PsycINFO, and registers of ongoing trials. In addition, we searched all
reference lists of included trials, and we contacted experts in the field, in an 
attempt to locate trials.
SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing
selective oestrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) with placebo, no treatment, other
medical treatment, or surgery for endometriosis.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures
recommended by Cochrane. Two review authors independently selected trials for
inclusion, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data using data extraction forms.
We used risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for reporting
dichotomous data. Primary review outcomes were relief of pelvic pain and adverse 
events. Secondary outcomes included quality of life, recurrence rate, and
economic and fertility outcomes.
MAIN RESULTS: We included only one RCT, which included 93 women, comparing the
SERM raloxifene with placebo in biopsy-proven endometriosis. All women first
underwent complete surgical excision of all lesions. Evidence was of very low
quality: the main limitation was imprecision - with very sparse data from only
one small study, which included only women after surgical treatment. Relief of
pelvic pain The included study did not specifically measure the primary outcome
of pain relief. Study authors reported that time to return of pelvic pain
(defined as two months of pain equal to or more severe than pain at study entry) 
was more rapid in the raloxifene group (P = 0.03). Adverse events The included
study reported adverse events such as pelvic pain, ovarian cyst, headache,
migraine, and depression. We are uncertain whether raloxifene improves the
incidence of pelvic pain (RR 1.25, 95% CI 0.63 to 2.45), ovarian cysts (RR 1.57, 
95% CI 0.55 to 4.43), headache (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.43), migraine (RR 0.73,
95% CI 0.28 to 1.95), depression (RR 1.96, 95% CI 0.63 to 6.06), or other adverse
events (RR 0.08, 95% CI 0.00 to 1.30) (all: 1 study, n = 93; very low-quality
evidence). Quality of life The study described a statistically significant
difference in mental health quality of life (QoL) by 12 months, in favour of
placebo treatment (mean difference 11.1, 95% CI 0.01 to 21.19). Other QoL data
did not differ between groups but were not reported in detail. Recurrence rate,
fertility, and economic outcomes We are uncertain whether raloxifene improves the
recurrence rate of endometriosis, proven by biopsy, when compared to placebo (RR 
1.20, 95% CI 0.66 to 2.21; 1 study, n = 93; very low-quality evidence).
This suggests that if 28% of women taking placebo have biopsy-proven recurrence
of endometriosis, between 19% and 62% of those taking raloxifene will do so.
These outcomes are prone to bias, as not all women had an actual second
laparoscopy. Recurrence based on symptoms (non-menstrual pain, dysmenorrhoea, or 
dyspareunia) was described; in these cases, symptoms improved after use of
raloxifene as well as after use of placebo. The included study did not report
data on economic outcomes. No comparative data were available on pregnancy, as
the study included only women who agreed to postpone pregnancy until after the
study endpoint; the few pregnancies that did occur were uneventful but were
regarded as an adverse event.  AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Based on a single, small RCT
and incomplete data, we are uncertain of the effects of SERMs on pain relief in
surgically treated patients with endometriosis. The included study was stopped
prematurely because of higher pain scores among women who took SERMs when
compared to scores among those receiving placebo. Further research is needed to
fully evaluate the role of SERMs in endometriosis.

AIMS: Deep infiltrative endometriosis (DIE) may cause pelvic pain and thus
negatively affect the function of different structures. We hypothesized that
women with DIE may have dysfunctions of the pelvic floor muscles (PFM) and lower 
limb muscles (LLM).
METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 160 women (80 with DIE under
hormonal treatment and 80 women without DIE), who were assessed to determine the 
presence of pelvic symptoms (dysmenorrhea, chronic pelvic pain (CPP),
deep/penetration dyspareunia, dysuria, dyschezia, and vulvodynia), PFM function
(PERFECT scheme, presence of hypertonia and trigger points, and muscle
contraction and relaxation), abdominal muscle pain (Carnett's test), and muscle
shortening in LLM (Thomas, Pace, and Ober tests).
RESULTS: Women with DIE presented more CPP (30% vs.5%;p<0.001), dysuria (12.5%
vs.3.75%;p=0.043), and dyschezia (47.5% vs.2.5%;p<0.001) than the control group. 
Moreover, they had higher PFM hypertonia (28.75% vs.13.75%;p=0.02), weaker PFM
contraction (36.35% vs. 2.5%; p<0.001), and incomplete PFM relaxation (45%
vs.13.75%;p<0.001). Women with DIE had a higher rate of positive results in the
Carnett's test (21.25% vs. 2.5%;p<0.001) than the control group. Moreover, they
had a higher frequency of shortening of the anterior thigh (30% vs.10% in both
LLM;p<0.001), piriformis (16.25% vs. 6.25%;p<0.001), and iliotibial band muscles 
(bilateral;p<0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that the presence of pain
increased the risk of PFM hypertonia (OR=3.73[1.26-11.07];p=0.018) and caused
difficulty in PFM relaxation [OR=2.98[1.01-9.37];p=0.049).
CONCLUSION: Women with DIE exhibited a greater number of pelvic symptoms and
greater PFM/LLM dysfunction than those in the control group. Pain was associated 
with PFM hypertonia and difficulty in PFM relaxation.

BACKGROUND: Ectopic decidua is the presence of decidual tissue outside the
uterus. Ectopic decidua of the appendix is a rare entity that can present with
abdominal symptoms mimicking appendicitis. We report a case of a 39-year-old
female patient at 27 weeks gestational age with a 2-day history of right lower
quadrant abdominal pain.
CASE PRESENTATION: The patient was referred to our hospital with suspicion of
either acute appendicitis or threatened rupture of the uterus, the latter of
which was considered unlikely following close examination. Therefore, she
underwent emergency appendectomy via laparotomy. Microscopic examination revealed
decidual tissue with myxoid degeneration in the subserosal layer of the tip side 
of the appendix, without endometriosis, which was compatible with ectopic decidua
(deciduosis).
CONCLUSIONS: Because it is extremely difficult to distinguish ectopic decidua of 
the appendix from acute appendicitis, even with various imaging modalities, we
should be aware that ectopic decidua of the appendix is a differential diagnosis 
for acute appendicitis in pregnant women.

BACKGROUND: Increased risk of miscarriage has been reported for women with
specific chronic health conditions. A broader investigation of chronic diseases
and miscarriage risk may uncover patterns across categories of illness. The
objective of this study was to study the risk of miscarriage according to various
preexisting chronic diseases.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a registry-based study. Registered pregnancies
(n = 593,009) in Norway between 2010 and 2016 were identified through 3 national 
health registries (birth register, general practitioner data, and patient
registries). Six broad categories of illness were identified, comprising 25
chronic diseases defined by diagnostic codes used in general practitioner and
patient registries. We required that the diseases were diagnosed before the
pregnancy of interest. Miscarriage risk according to underlying chronic diseases 
was estimated as odds ratios (ORs) using generalized estimating equations
adjusting for woman's age. The mean age of women at the start of pregnancy was
29.7 years (SD 5.6 years). We observed an increased risk of miscarriage among
women with cardiometabolic diseases (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.31; p-value
<0.001). Within this category, risks were elevated for all conditions:
atherosclerosis (2.22; 1.42 to 3.49; p-value <0.001), hypertensive disorders
(1.19; 1.13 to 1.26; p-value <0.001), and type 2 diabetes (1.38; 1.26 to 1.51;
p-value <0.001). Among other categories of disease, risks were elevated for
hypoparathyroidism (2.58; 1.35 to 4.92; p-value 0.004), Cushing syndrome (1.97;
1.06 to 3.65; p-value 0.03), Crohn's disease (OR 1.31; 95% CI: 1.18 to 1.45;
p-value 0.001), and endometriosis (1.22; 1.15 to 1.29; p-value <0.001). Findings 
were largely unchanged after mutual adjustment. Limitations of this study include
our inability to adjust for measures of socioeconomic position or lifestyle
characteristics, in addition to the rareness of some of the conditions providing 
limited power.
CONCLUSIONS: In this registry study, we found that, although risk of miscarriage 
was largely unaffected by maternal chronic diseases, risk of miscarriage was
associated with conditions related to cardiometabolic health. This finding is
consistent with emerging evidence linking cardiovascular risk factors to
pregnancy complications.

Phthalate esters (PAEs) are one of the most widely used plasticizers in polymer
products and humans are increasingly exposed to them. The constant exposure to
PAEs-contained products has raised some concerns against human health. Thus, the 
impacts of PAEs and their metabolites on human health require a comprehensive
study for a better understanding of the associated risks. Here, we attempt to
review eight main health effects of PAE exposure according to the most up-to-date
studies. We found that epidemiological studies demonstrated a consistent
association between PAE exposure (especially DEHP and its metabolites) and a
decrease in sperm quality in males and symptom development of ADHD in children.
Overall, we found insufficient evidence and lack of consistency of the
association between PAE exposure and cardiovascular diseases (hypertension,
atherosclerosis, and CHD), thyroid diseases, respiratory diseases, diabetes,
obesity, kidney diseases, intelligence performance in children, and other
reproductive system-related diseases (anogenital distance, girl precocious
puberty, and endometriosis). Future studies (longitudinal and follow-up
investigations) need to thoroughly perform in large-scale populations to yield
more consistent and powerful results and increase the precision of the
association as well as enhance the overall understanding of potential human
health risks of PAEs in long-term exposure.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: To describe the surgical management and the risks of
postoperative complications of patients suffering from urinary tract
endometriosis (UTE) in France in 2017.
DESIGN: Multicentric retrospective cohort pilot study.
SETTING: Department of Gynecology in 31 expert endometriosis centers.
PATIENTS: All women managed surgically for UTE, from January 1st to December 31st
2017. We distinguished patient with isolated bladder endometriosis (IBE) or
isolated ureteral endometriosis (IUE) and patients associating both locations
(mixed locations, ML).
INTERVENTION: Surgeons belonging to the FRIENDS group enrolled patients by
filling a 24 items questionnaire on the day of the inclusion and three month
later. Data were collected on operative routes, surgical management and
postoperative complications according to the Clavien-Dindo classification, in a
single anonymized database.
MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 232 patients from 31 centers were
included. IBE was found in 82 patients (35.3%), IUE in 126 patients (54.4%) ML in
24 patients (10.3%). Surgery was performed by laparoscopy, laparotomy or
robot-assisted laparoscopy in 74.1%, 11.2% and 14.7% of cases respectively. Among
the 150 ureteral lesions (IUE and ML), 114 were managed with ureterolysis (76%), 
28 with ureteral resections (18.7%), 4 with nephrectomies (2.7%) and 23 with
cystectomies (15.3%). Concerning bladder endometriosis, a partial cystectomy was 
performed in 94.3% of cases. We reported 61 postoperative complications (26.3%), 
44 low grade complications according to the Clavien-Dindo classification (18%),
16 grade III complications (7%) and one grade IV complication (peritonitis).
CONCLUSION: The surgical management of ureteral and bladder endometriosis is
usually feasible and safe through laparoscopic surgery. Ureteral resection, when 
necessary, is more strongly associated with laparotomy and with more
complications compared to other procedures. Prospective controlled studies are
still mandatory to assess the best surgical management for the patients.

Hyperactivation of the CXCL12-CXCR4 axis occurs in endometriosis; the therapeutic
potential of treatments aimed at global inhibition of the axis was recently
demonstrated. As CXCR4 is predominantly expressed on epithelial cells in the
uterus, our aim was to explore the effects of targeted disruption of CXCR4 in
endometriosis lesions. Uteri derived from adult female mice homozygous for a
floxed allele of CXCR4 and co-expressing Cre recombinase under control of
progesterone receptor were sutured onto the peritoneum of cycling GFP+ host mice.
Four weeks post endometriosis induction the number of lesions that developed was 
found to be significantly lower in Cxcr4-conditional knockout lesions relative to
that of controls (37.5% vs. 68.8% vs. respectively). In Cxcr4-knockout lesions
that developed, reduced epithelial proliferation was associated with a lower
ratio of epithelial to total lesion area compared to controls. Moreover, while in
control lesions CD3+ lymphocytes were largely excluded from the epithelial
compartment, in Cxcr4-knockout lesions CD3+ lymphocytes infiltrated the
Cxcr4-deficient epithelium in the diestrus and proestrus stages. Our data
demonstrate that local CXCR4 expression is necessary for proliferation of the
epithelial compartment of endometriosis lesions, its absence compromising lesion 
numbers, and suggests a role for epithelial CXCR4 in lesion immune evasion.

Elagolix is a novel, oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor antagonist
indicated for the management of moderate to severe pain associated with
endometriosis and heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids.
Consistent with its mechanism of action, elagolix exhibited dose-dependent
suppression of estradiol (E2) in clinical studies. A dose-response model that
describes the relationship between elagolix dosages and average E2 levels was
combined with a previously published quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP)
model of calcium homeostasis to predict bone mineral density (BMD) changes during
and following elagolix treatment. In the QSP model, changes in E2 levels were
linked to downstream changes in markers of bone resorption (carboxyterminal
cross-linked telopeptide of type 1 collagen [CTX]), formation (N-terminal
propeptide of type 1 procollagen [P1NP]) and BMD. The BMD, CTX, and P1NP
predictions by the QSP model were validated against observed data from four phase
III clinical trials of elagolix in premenopausal women with endometriosis. BMD,
CTX, and P1NP were successfully described by the QSP model, without any model
fitting, suggesting that the model was validated for further predictions of
elagolix effects on BMD. Simulations using the validated QSP model demonstrated
that elagolix 150 mg once daily dosing for 24 months is predicted to result in
-0.91% change from baseline in lumbar spine BMD. The QSP model simulation results
were part of the totality of evidence to support the approved duration of therapy
for elagolix 150 mg once daily in patients with endometriosis.

The WNT family of proteins are crucial in numerous developmental pathways and
tissue homeostasis. WNT4, in particular, is uniquely implicated in development of
the female phenotype in the fetus, and in the maintenance of Müllerian and
reproductive tissues. WNT4 dysfunction or dysregulation can drive sex reversal
syndromes, highlighting the key role of WNT4 in sex determination. WNT4 is also
critical in gynecologic pathologies later in life, including several cancers,
uterine fibroids, endometriosis, and infertility. The role of WNT4 in normal
decidualization, implantation, and gestation is being increasingly appreciated,
while aberrant activation of WNT4 signaling is being linked to both gynecologic
and breast cancers. Notably, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at the WNT4
gene locus are strongly associated with these pathologies and may functionally
link estrogen and estrogen receptor signaling to upregulation and activation of
WNT4 signaling. Importantly, in each of these developmental and disease states,
WNT4 gene expression and downstream WNT4 signaling are regulated and executed by 
myriad tissue-specific pathways. Here, we review the roles of WNT4 in women's
health with a focus on sex development, and gynecologic and breast pathologies,
and our understanding of how WNT4 signaling is controlled in these contexts.
Defining WNT4 functions provides a unique opportunity to link sex-specific
signaling pathways to women's health and disease.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether it is possible to predict the risk of ureteral
endometriosis (UE) using a mathematical model based on preoperative findings.
DESIGN: Prospective observational study conducted between January 2017 and
April 2020.
SETTING: Tertiary-level academic referral center.
PATIENT(S): Three hundred consecutive women of reproductive age with a diagnosis 
of posterior deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) scheduled for laparoscopic
surgery.
INTERVENTION(S): Before surgery, anamnestic data and the severity of
endometriosis-related symptoms were evaluated, and all patients underwent a
complete gynecological examination. Transvaginal and transabdominal ultrasound
were performed to map the endometriotic lesion. Ureteral involvement was
surgically and histologically confirmed.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): To select important risk factors for UE and determine a 
suitable functional form for continuous predictors, we used the multivariable
fractional polynomial.
RESULTS: UE was surgically found in 145 women (48.3%). Based on our multivariable
polynomial mathematical model, UE was significantly associated with adenomyosis, 
parametrial involvement, and previous surgery for endometriosis. A posterior DIE 
nodule with a transverse diameter >1.8 cm was associated with a higher
probability of ureteral involvement.
CONCLUSIONS: Posterior DIE nodule with a transverse diameter >1.8 cm,
adenomyosis, parametrial involvement, and previous surgery for endometriosis
appear to be good predictors of UE.

STUDY OBJECTIVE: Learning to evaluate and treat chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is an
established curriculum objective within the Fellowship in Minimally Invasive
Gynecologic Surgery (FMIGS). Our aim was to investigate current educational
experiences related to the evaluation and management of CPP and the impacts of
those experiences on FMIGS fellows and recent fellowship graduates, including
satisfaction, confidence in management, and clinical interest in CPP.
DESIGN: The AAGL-Elevating Gynecologic Surgery Special Interest Group for pelvic 
pain developed a 33-item survey tool to investigate the following topics: 1)
current educational experiences with the assessment and management of patients
with CPP, 2) satisfaction with fellowship training in CPP, 3) perceived
preparedness to treat patients with CPP, 4) plans to incorporate management of
CPP into clinical practice, and 5) perceived desires to expand CPP exposure.
Composite scores were created to examine experiences related to diseases
associated with CPP and pharmaceutical and procedural treatment options.
SETTING: Electronic survey.
PATIENTS: Not applicable.
INTERVENTIONS: The survey was distributed via AAGL email lists and offered on
FMIGS social media sites August 2017 to November 2017 to all active FMIGS fellows
and individuals who graduated the fellowship during the preceding five years.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Fifty-three of 82 (65%) current FMIGS fellows and 
104 of 169 (62%) recent fellowship graduates completed the survey. Only, 66% of
current fellows endorsed working with a fellowship faculty member whose clinical 
work focused on CPP. Most current fellows reported having a "good amount" or
"extensive" experience with superficial endometriosis (39/53, 74%) and deeply
infiltrative endometriosis (34/53, 64%), while the majority reported having "no" 
or "little" experience with frequently comorbid conditions like irritable bowel
syndrome (68%), pelvic floor tension myalgia (55%), and interstitial
cystitis/painful bladder syndrome (51%). For both current fellows and recent
graduates, increased CPP Disease Experience composite scores were associated with
satisfaction with CPP training (current fellows OR 1.9, p=0.0016; recent
graduates OR 1.5, p=0.0006), perceived preparedness to treat patients with CPP
(current fellows OR 2.0, p=0.0021; recent graduates OR 1.5, p=0.0006), and the
desire to incorporate the treatment of CPP into future clinical practice (current
fellows OR 1.8, p=0.0099; recent graduates OR 1.3, p=0.0178). Over 80% (43/53) of
current fellows indicated that they believed an expanded pelvic pain curriculum
should be part of the FMIGS fellowship.
CONCLUSION: This needs assessment of FMIGS fellows and recent graduates suggests 
that there are gaps between FMIGS curriculum objectives and current educational
experiences, and that fellows desire increased CPP exposure. Expansion and
standardization of the CPP educational experience is needed and could lead to
increased focus on this disease process among subspecialty benign gynecologic
surgeons.

ABSTRACT: Endometriosis is a benign condition of the female genital system,
characterized by endometrial tissue external to the uterine cavity. Of all cases 
with endometriosis, the incidence of umbilical endometriosis is only 0.29%.
Umbilical endometriosis typical presents with symptoms including cyclical pain,
bleeding, and swelling of the nodule. Morphological changes in the epidermis, as 
in this case, simulating a seborrheic keratosis both clinically and
microscopically, can initially mask the underlying endometriosis and prolong the 
course of treatment. A thorough anamnesis and examination revealing the
characteristic symptoms and findings coupled with a representative biopsy is
essential to correctly diagnose umbilical endometriosis.

Acute pelvic pain is a common presenting complaint in both the emergency room and
outpatient settings. Pelvic pain of gynecologic origin in postmenopausal women
occurs less frequently than in premenopausal women; however, it has important
differences in etiology. The most common causes of postmenopausal pelvic pain
from gynecologic origin are ovarian cysts, uterine fibroids, pelvic inflammatory 
disease, and ovarian neoplasm. Other etiologies of pelvic pain are attributable
to urinary, gastrointestinal, and vascular systems. As the optimal imaging
modality varies for these etiologies, it is important to narrow the differential 
diagnosis before choosing the initial diagnostic imaging examination.
Transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasound are the best initial imaging
techniques when the differential is primarily of gynecologic origin. CT with
intravenous (IV) contrast is more useful if the differential diagnosis remains
broad. MRI without IV contrast or MRI without and with IV contrast, as well as CT
without IV contrast may also be used for certain differential considerations. The
American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based
guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a
multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an
extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and 
the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness
Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or

specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or
equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend
imaging or treatment.

The review aims to explore circulating small non- coding regulatory Ribonucleic
Acids (miRNA) as biomarkers of endometriosis; a reproductive age group disorder. 
miRNA are linked with genetic, epigenetic and angiogenic factors, hormones,
cytokines, chemokines, oxidative stress (OS) markers, mediators of inflammation, 
hypoxia, angiogenesis and altered immune system contributing to the pathogenesis 
of endometriosis. Hormonal imbalance occurs by decreased levels of miRNAs -23a
and miRNAs -23b and increase in miRNAs -:135a, 135b, 29c and 194-3p. Angiogenesis
by vascular endothelial growth factor is attributed to increased miRNAs -126,
miRNAs -210, miRNAs -21, miRNAs -199a-5p and miRNAs 20A. OS upregulates miRNAs
-302a by increased levels of Tumor Necrosis factor (TNF)-α, TNF- β and
Interleukin -1β. Upregulation of miRNAs -199a and miRNAs -16 promotes
inflammation and cell proliferation in the endometriotic lesions. The gold
standard to diagnose endometriosis is laparoscopy, yet miRNA can be validated as 
diagnostic tool for detection, progression and prevention of endometriosis in
large, independent cohorts of women, with and without endometriosis.

Endometriosis is a common and painful condition. We present a case of a
33-year-old woman who had delivered triplets after in vitro fertilisation (IVF)
for male factor infertility. She did not have any clinical features suggestive of
endometriosis before the IVF treatment. The patient presented 7 years after
conception, with premensural and postmenstrual abdominal pain and intense pain on
defecation. The patient was diagnosed to have endometriosis in the tract of
transvaginal ovum pick up in the right pouch of Douglas and right distal
uterosacral ligament. The patient underwent excision of a nodule of
endometriosis. The patient is asymptomatic 1 month after surgery. Histopathology 
analysis revealed features suggestive of endometriosis. The needle ovum pick up
tract must have implanted the endometriotic tissue near the pararectal tissue.
This is an unreported and late complication of IVF treatment.

BACKGROUND: Endometriosis affects approximately 10% of women, with
well-documented delays between initial presentation with symptoms and diagnosis. 
In England, women typically seek help first in primary care, making this setting 
pivotal in women's pathways to diagnosis and treatment. English General
Practitioner (GP) perspectives on managing possible endometriosis have not been
previously reported.
AIM: To explore what GPs identify as important considerations when caring for
women with symptoms that raise the possibility of endometriosis.
DESIGN AND SETTING: English primary care.
METHOD: Semi-structured scenario-based telephone interviews with 42 GPs based
around a fictional scenario of a woman presenting to primary care with symptoms
suggesting possible endometriosis. Interviews were thematically coded and
analysed.
RESULTS: Managing possible endometriosis in primary care brings challenges. While
knowledge and awareness were pre-requisites for considering endometriosis, other 
important considerations were raised. Symptoms suggestive of endometriosis are
non-specific, making endometriosis one possible consideration of many. GPs move
through a diagnostic hierarchy to exclude sinister causes and utilise trials of
treatment as both therapeutic interventions and diagnostic tools - processes
which take time. An endometriosis label or diagnosis has advantages and risks.
GPs reported sharing decisions about investigation and referral whilst holding
women's priorities as pivotal. These conversations were underpinned by their
knowledge of uncertainties and unknowns, including the wide spectrum and
unpredictability of endometriosis.
CONCLUSION: GPs considerations are more complex than simply lacking awareness.
The unknowns surrounding endometriosis matter to GPs. Further research and
tailored resources for primary care, where women present with undifferentiated
symptoms, are needed.

AIM: Endometriosis is a common gynecological disorder characterized by chronic
pelvic pain and infertility, which negatively affects women's health worldwide.
AFAP1-AS1 has been implicated in endometriosis lesions recently, but its
mechanism of endometriosis progression remains unclear.
METHODS: Endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) were used to identify the role of
AFAP1-AS1 in endometriosis. The migratory capability was determined by transwell.
Gene and protein expressions were identified by quantitative real-time polymerase
chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting. Cell viability and apoptosis were 
detected by MTT assays and flow cytometry, respectively. Luciferase report assays
were used to identify the interaction of AFAP1-AS1, miR-424-5p and signal
transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3).
RESULTS: AFAP1-AS1 knockdown or miR-424-5p overexpression inhibited proliferation
and migration, and promoted apoptosis in ESCs. In addition, knockdown of
AFAP1-AS1 repressed the expression of ki-67 and Bcl-2, and promoted the levels of
cleaved caspase-3 and Bax. Furthermore, knockdown of AFAP1-AS1 inhibited the
conversion of E-cadherin to N-cadherin and the expression of Snail. Moreover,
AFAP1-AS1 activated the STAT3/transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1)/Smad2 axis
via directly targeting miR-424-5p. The regulatory effect of AFAP1-AS1 silencing
in ESC migration, proliferation, and apoptosis was reversed by miR-424-5p
inhibition or STAT3 overexpression.
CONCLUSIONS: AFAP1-AS1 silencing could inhibit cell proliferation and promote
apoptosis by regulating STAT3/TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway via targeting
miR-424-5p in ESCs. AFAP1-AS1 may be a potential therapeutic target of
controlling the progression of endometriosis.

AIM: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the current state and clinical
characteristics of spontaneous hemoperitoneum in pregnancy (SHiP) in Japan by
performing a comprehensive survey.
METHODS: We reviewed data on pregnant women who developed SHiP during 2013-2017
(for 5 years), and were admitted to any of the perinatal centers in Japan. The
survey assessed maternal background and maternal and neonatal prognosis. We
divided the cases into two groups, favorable and poor prognosis groups, and made 
comparisons between the two groups.
RESULTS: Of the 407 facilities in Japan, 267 (66%) facilities responded to our
survey. Overall, 31 cases of SHiP were registered. Maternal death occurred in one
case (3%) due to liver bleeding with an unknown cause. Of 23 cases with a SHiP
onset during pregnancy, 12 (53%) had been misdiagnosed as placental abruption.
The prognosis for the fetuses included miscarriage or stillbirth in three cases
(10%) and asphyxia in 12 cases (42%). There was no significant correlation
between the amount of intra-abdominal blood loss and neonatal prognosis based on 
umbilical artery pH. Incidences of preterm birth <32 gestational weeks (adjusted 
odds ratio, 35.75; 95% confidence interval, 3.46-368.82) were higher in the poor 
prognosis group than that in the favorable group. Endometriosis and artificial
reproductive techniques were both associated with 19% of all cases of SHiP.
CONCLUSION: SHiP was associated with maternal death and poor fetal prognosis.
Prematurity and persistent uterine contractions which might be misdiagnosed as
placental abruption seem to contribute to poor fetal prognosis.

Endometriosis (EM) is defined as endometrial tissues found outside the uterus.
Growth and development of endometriotic cells in ectopic sites can be promoted
via multiple pathways, including MAPK/MEK/ERK, PI3K/Akt/mTOR, NF-κB, Rho/ROCK,
reactive oxidative stress, tumor necrosis factor, transforming growth factor-β,
Wnt/β-catenin, vascular endothelial growth factor, estrogen, and cytokines. The
underlying pathophysiological mechanisms include proliferation, apoptosis,
autophagy, migration, invasion, fibrosis, angiogenesis, oxidative stress,
inflammation, and immune escape. Current medical treatments for EM are mainly
hormonal and symptomatic, and thus the development of new, effective, and safe
pharmaceuticals targeting specific molecular and signaling pathways is needed.
Here, we systematically reviewed the literature focused on pharmaceuticals that
specifically target the molecular and signaling pathways involved in the
pathophysiology of EM. Potential drug targets, their upstream and downstream
molecules with key aberrant signaling, and the regulatory mechanisms promoting
the growth and development of endometriotic cells and tissues were discussed.
Hormonal pharmaceuticals, including melatonin, exerts proapoptotic via regulating
matrix metallopeptidase activity while nonhormonal pharmaceutical sorafenib
exerts antiproliferative effect via MAPK/ERK pathway and antiangiogenesis
activity via VEGF/VEGFR pathway. N-acetyl cysteine, curcumin, and ginsenoside
exert antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects via radical scavenging activity. 
Natural products have high efficacy with minimal side effects; for example,
resveratrol and epigallocatechin gallate have multiple targets and provide
synergistic efficacy to resolve the complexity of the pathophysiology of EM,
showing promising efficacy in treating EM. Although new medical treatments are
currently being developed, more detailed pharmacological studies and large sample
size clinical trials are needed to confirm the efficacy and safety of these
treatments in the near future.

Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that has been reported to be
associated with immune system dysfunction. On the other hand, the effect of
Vitamin D as an immune modulator and its relation with several autoimmune and
inflammatory diseases has been previously investigated. Moreover, several studies
have reported the polymorphisms of VDR and VDBP genes can change the functions of
these molecules. Therefore, these polymorphisms may be influential on
endometriosis pathogenesis. In this study, we aimed at evaluating the association
between VDR gene (FokI (F/f), BsmI (B/b), ApaI (A/a), TaqI (T/t)), and VDBP gene 
(GC*1S, GC*1F, and GC*2) polymorphisms with endometriosis in Iranian women
population. This case-control study was performed on 120 women with endometriosis
and 110 healthy women. ARMS-PCR and PCR-RFLP methods were used to inspect
polymorphisms in VDR and VDBP genes, respectively. Based on the results, there
was no statistically significant difference between the cases with endometriosis 
and control subjects in terms of genotypes and allele frequencies of VDR and VDBP
gene polymorphisms. These data suggest that VDR and VDBP gene polymorphisms may
have no role in endometriosis susceptibility in Iranian women.

Scar endometriosis is a rare condition highly related to history of abdominal
surgery. Due to the low incidence, it is often misdiagnosed. A woman presented to
the surgery outpatient clinic with a mass near her C-section scar. Physical
examination and ultrasound suggested Incisional Hernia while intraoperative
finding revealed a mass suggestive of endometriosis which later confirmed by
pathology examination. Scar endometriosis is a common subtype of extra-pelvic
endometriosis. Iatrogenic transplantation is speculated to be its
etiopathogenesis. Preoperatively, it is challenging to differentiate
endometriosis from another abdominal masses. The definitive diagnosis is based on
laparoscopy or surgery with histological verification. Chronic pain is complex
and often involves multiple factors beyond simply a diagnosis of endometriosis,
but it is important to think of endometriosis on women patients presenting with a
mass and cyclic pain with history of surgery involving a large amount of
endometrial cell.

Endometriosis is a common chronic gynecological disorder that undoubtedly impacts
on quality of life, and is one of the more complex and mysterious illnesses of
our century, which is associated with the improper growth of endometrial tissue
outside of the uterine cavity. This pathologically implanted tissue can be found 
most frequently in the minor pelvis, but also in the peritoneal cavity, and can
affect many organs, leading to chronic pelvic pain syndrome, infertility, and
dysmenorrhea. Endometrial tissue is a particularly dynamic tissue that has a
direct impact on the progression of the disease, with altered immunity, as well
as cytokine storms within the metaplastic endometriotic site, as possible key
factors. Currently, diagnosis of this mysterious chronic illness relies on
performing a laparoscopic procedure with tissue sampling. One of the most
troublesome outcomes of this unintended progression is that we lack any specific,
sensitive, non-invasive diagnostic tools. Currently, the vast majority of regime 
stewardship options rely on anti-contraceptive drugs, or other remedies that
suppress the release of estrogen through the gonads-although in most clinical
trials, endometriosis is a chronic progressive disorder that depends mostly on
the high concentration of estrogen. Moreover, many specific trials have
demonstrated that the eutopic endometrial cells in individuals with endometriosis
remain much more resistant to the immunological annihilation process caused by
certain elements of the immune system. Nevertheless, eutopic endometrial cells
have the potential to similarly escalate the expression of aromatase receptors on
the surface of the pathological cells, which in the final cascade cause an
increase in the concentration of estrogen, as well as other inflammatory proteins
that contribute to pathological outgrowth. Data reveal occurrence among
first-degree relatives, suggesting that the specific cascade could be related to 
inherited as well as epigenetic (acquired) mechanisms. In women with the disease,
confirmed by laparoscopic procedures, diagnosis of endometriosis can be
established also via detection by gene polymorphism in the genes which are
responsible for responsible for the detoxification phase of estrogen receptors
and other immunomodulator components. A recent publication aims to reveal a new
prospect for the non-invasive diagnosis, detection, and estimation of certain
biomarkers for much more specific investigation of the disease's progression.

INTRODUCTION: Endometriosis is a common disease in women, which requires a
medical and surgical approach. Surgical societies recommend a multidisciplinary
management in tertiary referral centers. The objective of our study is to assess 
the surgical management of endometriosis in France by studying the surgeons'
attitude for bowel and urinary endometriosis.
METHODS: We sent a survey to french endometriosis surgeons. We did a descriptive 
analysis and a comparative analysis between surgeons who believe endometriosis
surgeons should be considered as "pelvic surgeons", able to treat bowel and
urinary involvement.
RESULTS: We included 90 answers, from gynaecologic surgeons from all over France.
Gynaecologic surgeons perform minor bowel and urinary tract surgery, and more
complex procedures are performed with digestive or urological surgeon (bowel
resection 85% of cases, ureteric resection-anastomosis 84% of cases, ureteric
reimplantation 91% of cases). Surgeons considering that gynaecologists should be 
able to deal with urinary and bowel endometriosis carry out more bowel and
urinary procedures. They have an additional training in surgery and perform more 
endometriosis surgery every year. However, bowel and urinary endometriosis
management by gynaecologic surgeons is contested among gynaecologists.
CONCLUSION: To this day, there is no dedicated training in France to coach
gynaecologist to perform such procedures. Multidisciplinary approach is essential
for quality care, in expert centers. The basic education of gynaecologic surgeons
does not allow them to perform complex pelvic surgeries, but qualifications can
be gained for these interventions with a special training, and perform a greater 
number of surgeries.

17β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (17β-HSD1) and steroid sulfatase (STS)
are involved in the synthesis of the most potent estrogen in the human body,
estradiol (E2). These enzymes are known to play a pivotal role in the progression
of estrogen-dependent diseases, such as breast cancer and endometriosis.
Therefore, the inhibition of 17β-HSD1 and/or STS represents a promising avenue to
modulate the growth of estrogen-dependent tumors or lesions. We recently
established the key role of a bromoethyl side chain added at the C3-position of a
16β-carbamoyl-benzyl-E2 nucleus to covalently inhibit 17β-HSD1. To extend the
structure-activity relationship study to the C16β-position of this new selective 
irreversible inhibitor (PBRM), we synthesized a series of analog compounds by
changing the nature of the C16β-side chain but keeping the 2-bromoethyl group at 
position C3. We determined their 17β-HSD1 inhibitions in T-47D cells
(transformation of E1 into E2), but we did not obtain a stronger 17β-HSD1
inhibitor than PBRM. Compounds 16 and 17 were found to be more likely to bind to 
the catalytic site and showed a promising but moderate inhibitory activity with
estimated IC50 values of 0.5 and 0.7 µM, respectively (about 10 times higher than
PBRM). Interestingly, adding one or two sulfamate groups in the D-ring's
surroundings did not significantly decrease compounds' potential to inhibit
17β-HSD1, but clearly improved their potential to inhibit STS. These results open
the door to the development of a new family of steroid derivatives with dual
(17β-HSD1 and STS) inhibiting actions.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify the clinical characteristics of Chinese
patients with ovarian endometrioid carcinoma (EC) and clear cell carcinoma (CCC) 
and to assess the impact of concurrent endometriosis on this group.
METHODS: The present study reviewed the medical records of patients who received 
initial treatment and a postoperative pathological diagnosis of EC or CCC at our 
center in China between 1998 and 2018.
RESULTS: Of 211 patients, 73 had pure EC, and 91 had pure CCC, and the remaining 
47 had mixed cancer. The proportion of EC and CCC remained stable over past
21 years. The proportion of EC declined with aging and the age of EC onset to
incline to the young. And the age of CCC onset had two peaks, namely, 36 and
77 years. After review by the pathologist, the number of endometriosis cases
found in the pathological section of the analysis increased to 114, accounting
for 54% of patients. As the stage progressed, the appearance of endometriosis
became increasingly scarce in pathological sections(p = 0.001). Compared with
CCC, EC had a higher frequency of concurrent endometrial cancer (independent
endometrial lesions) and estrogen and progesterone receptor
expression(p = 0.000). And more patients were in premenopausal state in EC
group(p = 0.040). In the pure group, multivariate analysis showed that
correlation existed between relevance to endometriosis and worse
outcomes(p = 0.041). In patients with mixed cancer, mixed endometrioid histology 
was associated with better survival than other subtypes, even with stage III or
poorly differentiated tumors(p = 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: CCC and EC which are common in ovarian cancer patients who have
associated with endometriosis have distinct clinicopathological characteristics. 
Attention should be paid to ovarian cancer patients with a history of
endometriosis and those with concurrent endometriosis in pathological sections.

OBJECTIVES: The need for quality improvement within endometriosis healthcare is
widely acknowledged. The ENDOCARE questionnaire (ECQ) measures patient
centeredness of endometriosis care. The aims of this study were (1) to translate 
and culturally adapt ECQ into Swedish, (2) to evaluate validity (construct
validity), and (3) to measure reliability (internal consistency and test-retest
reliability).
DESIGN: This is a cross-sectional randomized study. Participants, Setting, and
Methods: ECQ was first translated according to a well-established guideline and
was thereafter sent to 500 randomly selected women with endometriosis, who had
visited participating clinics during the past 3 years. The first 150 women who
returned their questionnaires were immediately sent the same questionnaire again.
The ECQ consists of 3 parts. The first part contains demographic and clinical
questions, while part II has 38 items that are answered according to 2 aspects:
percentage of negative experience of care and mean personal importance. A
patient-centeredness score (PCS) is calculated based on these 2 aspects. The
items are also divided into 10 dimensions of care. Part III is a grading of
overall experience and an open-ended question on any missing aspect in the
questionnaire.
RESULTS: A total of 187 native Swedish-speaking women participated. Data
completeness was high (>90%). The overall PCS median was 3.5. The highest median 
PCS was found in the dimension regarding endometriosis clinic staff and the
lowest in emotional support and alleviation of fear and anxiety and the
involvement of significant others. Factor analysis could roughly confirm 2 of the
10 dimensions. The Cronbach's α coefficient for PCS ranged from 0.35 to 0.73. The
test-rest analysis showed acceptable reliability.
LIMITATIONS: The most important limitation was the relatively low participation
rate and the risk of recall bias. It is likely that women gave their answers
based on their most recent experiences.
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our results indicate that the Swedish version of the ECQ is
a usable instrument to measure patient centeredness in endometriosis care, but
due to the unstable factor analysis, conclusions based on the dimensions should
be made with caution.

Background: We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of echo
contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) during high-intensity focused ultrasound
(HIFU) ablation therapy for abdominal wall endometriosis (AWE).
Methods: A total of 67 patients with AWE were treated with HIFU ablation, and
their demographic characteristics were retrospectively analysed. Blood perfusion 
of the focal lesion was assessed before the operation, during ablation and after 
the operation with the use of an ultrasound contrast agent, and the effect of the
ultrasound contrast agent on treatment was assessed over a 1-year follow-up
period. The degree of symptom relief and adverse effects were evaluated after
HIFU ablation.
Results: Eighty-two lesions were ablated in 67 patients. CEUS showed that all
lesions were successfully ablated with HIFU. The shrinkage ratio of the lesions
significantly increased over the follow-up period. Intermittent pain disappeared 
at 1 month after the operation, and the patients' pain scores significantly
decreased at the 1-year follow-up. The mean [± standard deviation (SD)] lesion
volume was 7.64±8.95 cm3 on B-mode ultrasound. The post-HIFU non-perfused volume 
was 18.34±24.08 cm3, and the rate of massive changes on greyscale imaging was
96.16%±5.44% at 12 months. During the procedure, the main complications were a
prickling sensation and tenderness in the treatment area and/or a transient "hot"
sensation on the skin. After the procedure, there was no obvious discomfort
except for pain. Two patients developed an approximately 1-cm area of skin that
exhibited a waxy appearance. Seven patients had haematuria. No severe
complications were observed.
Conclusions: Ultrasound contrast agents are effective and safe for evaluating the
effect of HIFU ablation on AWE, and this approach provides significant guidance
and evaluation benefits for the use of HIFU treatment for AWE without obvious
side effects.

OBJECTIVE: Migraine, endometriosis, and the comorbidity of both are frequent pain
disorders of special relevance for women. The neuropeptide calcitonin
gene-related peptide (CGRP) is critically involved in migraine, and
circumstantial evidence suggests a role in endometriosis. We assessed CGRP levels
at different times of menstrual cycle in four groups: healthy women, women with
migraine or endometriosis and with the comorbidity of both.
METHODS: Women with episodic migraine and women with a histologically confirmed
endometriosis were recruited from specialized centers. For CGRP determination
with a commercial enzyme immunoassay kit, cubital vein blood samples were
collected on menstrual cycle day 2 ± 2 (during menstruation) and on day 15 ± 2
(periovulatory period). The primary endpoint of the study was the absolute
difference of CGRP plasma levels between the menstrual and the periovulatory
phase of all study groups. Groups were compared using nonparametric test
procedures.
RESULTS: A total of 124 women were included in the study. The change of CGRP
plasma levels between menstruation and the periovulatory period was different
between groups (p = 0.007). Women with comorbid migraine and endometriosis showed
an increase of CGRP in the menstrual phase of +6.32 (interquartile range, IQR
-3.64-13.60) compared to the periovulatory time, while healthy controls had a
decrease of -10.14 (-22.54-0.91, p = 0.004). CGRP levels were different in the
periovulatory phase among groups (p = 0.008), with highest values in healthy
controls.
INTERPRETATION: CGRP levels change significantly during the menstrual cycle.
Different patterns in women with the comorbidity point to a deviant regulation of
CGRP release.

Összefoglaló. Az ultrahang-elasztográfia az elmúlt évek során egyre növekvő
figyelmet kapott a lágyszövetek elaszticitásának vizsgálatában. A módszer
használatát az teszi szükségessé, hogy egyes, a mechanikai tulajdonságaikban
különböző szövetek hasonló echogenitásúak lehetnek, valamint hogy egy adott
szövet megváltozott struktúrája vagy mechanikai tulajdonsága nem minden esetben
jár együtt a szövet hagyományos ultrahangképének megváltozásával. Az elmúlt
évtizedben a deformációs és a nyírási ultrahang-elasztográfia vált széles körben 
elérhetővé. Ezen új képalkotási technika egyre nagyobb szerepet tölt be a
szülészeti-nőgyógyászati ultrahang-diagnosztikában is. A nőgyógyászatban
szerephez juthat az endometriosis és az adenomyosis kimutatásában, valamint a
benignus és a malignus cervicalis és ovarialis képletek elkülönítésében. A
nőgyógyászathoz hasonlóan a szülészetben is jelentős változást hozhat az
ultrahang-elasztográfia: alkalmas lehet a szülésindukció sikerességének, a
koraszülés bekövetkezésének és a praeeclampsia kialakulásának előrejelzésére. Orv
Hetil. 2021; 162(18): 690-695. Summary. Ultrasound elastography has received
significant attention for the assessment and measurement of soft tissue elastic
properties in recent years. The advantage of ultrasound elastography lies in the 
fact that two different tissues can share similar echogenicities but may have
other mechanical properties or, on the contrary, mechanical abnormalities of a
designated tissue do not necessarily go hand in hand with an altered appearance
on a conventional ultrasound image. In the last decade, strain and shear-wave
elasticity imaging methods have become the most widely available among commercial
ultrasound equipments. The importance of this new method expands rapidly also in 
the field of obstetrics and gynecology. Ultrasound elastography has a promising
role in the diagnosis of endometriosis and adenomyosis and helps to differentiate
benign and malignant cervical and ovarian lesions. The use in the prediction of
the outcome of labor induction and preterm birth, and in the evaluation of
preeclampsia are emerging. Orv Hetil. 2021; 162(18): 690-695.

Growing evidence of successful outcomes achieved with the oocyte vitrification
technique has greatly contributed to its application in the field of fertility
preservation (FP). The population that can benefit from FP includes women at a
risk of losing their ovarian function because of either iatrogenic causes or
natural depletion of their ovarian reserve. Therefore, oncological patients and
healthy women who wish to delay motherhood for various reasons-elective FP-are
currently being offered this option. Satisfactory oocyte survival rates and
clinical outcomes, including cumulative live birth rates, have been reported in
recent years. These studies show that age at oocyte retrieval strongly affects
reproductive prognosis after FP. Therefore, elective FP patients should be
encouraged to decide before they reach the age of 35 years to significantly
increase their chances of success. The effect of age has also been observed in
patients with cancer and women diagnosed with endometriosis. The reproductive
outcome after FP is worse in patients with cancer, but a direct association
between the disease and reproductive outcome is yet to be proven. Young patients 
(≤35 years) with endometriosis who have undergone cystectomy before oocyte
retrieval for FP have worse outcomes than nonoperated women in age-matched
groups. In addition, the number of oocytes used per patient is closely related to
success in all populations, with considerable improvement in the result with the 
addition of a few oocytes, especially in healthy young patients.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the associations between intimate relationships,
psychological health, and endometriosis-related variables such as pelvic pain and
infertility.
METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, data were collected with an online survey
delivered through Qualtrics and posted on the Facebook page and website of a
patient association (Associazione Progetto Endometriosi-APE) in August 2020. The 
survey was composed of a researcher-made questionnaire and four validated
questionnaires assessing relational satisfaction (adapted Quality of Marriage
Index), dyadic coping (Dyadic Coping Questionnaire), and psychological health
(Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale).
RESULTS: Participants were 316 women (age: 35.9 ± 6.7) with endometriosis, who
reported being in an intimate relationship from at least one year. A greater
perceived negative impact of the disease on past and current intimate
relationships was associated with poorer psychological health, lower relational
satisfaction and worse dyadic coping. Women who perceived their partner as more
informed about endometriosis, more informed about and interested in their health 
conditions, and more likely to accompany them to the medical appointments, showed
greater relational satisfaction and dyadic coping. Relational satisfaction and
dyadic coping were associated with psychological health. A greater perceived
negative impact of endometriosis on intimate relationships was associated with
more severe pelvic pain (especially dyspareunia).
CONCLUSION: Endometriosis has a negative impact on intimate relationships, which 
is associated with poorer psychological health. For the women with the disease,
partner's support is important, and our findings suggest that effort should be
made to involve both members of the couple in multidisciplinary treatment.

OBJECTIVE: To review the diagnostic accuracy and determine the optimum imaging
modality for the detection of bladder deep endometriosis (DE) in women with a
clinical suspicion of endometriosis.
METHODS: A systematic review of studies published from inception to May 2020
using Embase, Google Scholar, Medline, PubMed and Scopus. Prospective studies,
which pre-operatively assessed any imaging modality for the presence of bladder
DE, and correlated with the gold standard surgical data as a reference were
included. The QUADAS-2 tool was used to assess quality. This review was
prospectively registered with PROSPERO (CRD42017059872).
RESULTS: Of the 1,977 references identified, 8 studies (n = 1,052) were included 
in the analysis. The overall pooled sensitivity and specificity, from which the
likelihood ratio of a positive test (LR+), likelihood ratio of a negative test
(LR-) and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were calculated, for all transvaginal
ultrasonography (TVS) techniques were 55 % (95 % CI 28-79%), 99 % (95 % CI
98-100%), 54.5 (95 % CI 18.9-157.4), 0.46 (95 % CI 0.25 - 0.85) and 119 (95 % CI 
24-577), and for only two-dimensional (2D) TVS 53 % (95 % CI 23-82%), 99 % (96 % 
CI 97-100%), 48.8 (95 % CI 13.1-181.4), 0.47 (95 % CI 0.23 - 0.98), and 104 (95 %
CI 15-711), respectively. Meta-analyses of the other modalities, namely magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) and transrectal endoscopic sonography (RES), were not
possible due to the limited number of studies. There was significant
heterogeneity and the studies were considered poor methodologically according to 
the QUADAS-2 tool.
CONCLUSIONS: Whilst the sensitivity of TVS was limited, the specificity was
excellent. Given that there is a paucity of literature for other imaging
modalities, until more studies are performed, TVS should be considered as the
first-line tool given it is the only modality with sufficient evidence.

BACKGROUND: Patients with endometriosis often experience infertility and have
poor IVF outcomes, with low fertilization and pregnancy rates. Although many
theories have tried to explain the mechanisms underlying infertility in these
patients, none of them is conclusive.
OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: In this review, we discuss the pathologic mechanisms
through which endometriosis likely leads to infertility along with the
therapeutic options used to date to treat endometriosis-related infertility and, 
thereby, to improve IVF outcomes in patients with endometriosis.
SEARCH METHODS: We performed a comprehensive literature search of clinical
outcomes in endometriosis and the molecular mechanisms contributing to oocyte
quality using the PubMed database to identify human and animal studies published 
from 1992 until September 2020. In total, 123 manuscripts were included.
OUTCOMES: While some theories propose that endometriosis patients may have
fertility problems as a result of decreased endometrial receptivity, others
reinforce the idea that infertility could be associated with oocyte alterations
and lower implantation rates. Single-cell RNA sequencing of oocytes from patients
with endometriosis has identified dysregulated mechanisms involved in steroid
metabolism and biosynthesis, response to oxidative stress and cell cycle
regulation. Dysregulation of these mechanisms could result in the poor IVF
outcomes observed in patients with endometriosis. Further, impaired
steroidogenesis may directly affect oocyte and embryo quality. Increased
oxidative stress in patients with endometriosis also has a detrimental effect on 
the follicular microenvironment, inducing cell cycle dysregulation in oocytes,
poor oocyte quality, and infertility. Moreover, granulosa cells in the context of
endometriosis undergo increased apoptosis and have an altered cell cycle that
could adversely affect folliculogenesis, oocyte and embryo quality, and IVF
outcomes. Endometriosis is also associated with inflammatory damage and impaired 
angiogenesis, which could be directly correlated with poor IVF outcomes. While
therapeutic options using GnRH analogues, progestins and aromatase inhibitors do 
not improve endometriosis-related infertility, anti-inflammatory agents and
antioxidant supplementation could improve oocyte quality as well as implantation 
and clinical pregnancy rates in patients with endometriosis.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS: Endometriosis is a heterogeneous disease whose pathogenesis
is complex and could affect fertility by altering a collection of molecular
mechanisms in oocytes. Thus, a single model is not sufficient to describe
endometriosis-related infertility. Dysregulation of steroidogenesis, oxidative
stress, cell cycle progression, inflammation and angiogenesis in the follicular
environment and oocytes in individuals with endometriosis are all possible
contributors to endometriosis-related infertility. Therefore, treatments
targeting these mechanisms could be therapeutic alternatives to improve IVF
outcomes for these patients.

Many studies have described the features of menstrually related migraines but
there is a lack of knowledge regarding the features of migraine in combined
hormonal contraceptive users (CHC). Hormone-withdrawal migraines in the pill-free
period could differ from those in the natural cycle. Gynaecologic comorbidities, 
like dysmenorrhea and endometriosis, but also depression or a family history
might modify the course of migraine. A better understanding of migraine features 
linked to special hormonal situations could improve treatment. For this
prospective cohort study, we conducted telephone interviews with women using a
CHC and reporting withdrawal migraine to collect information on migraine
frequency, intensity, triggers, symptoms, pain medication, gynaecologic history
and comorbidities (n = 48). A subset of women agreed to also document their
migraines in prospective diaries. The mean number of migraine days per cycle was 
4.2 (± 2.7). Around 50% of these migraines occurred during the hormone-free
interval. Migraine frequency was significantly higher in women who suffered from 
migraine before CHC start (5.0 ± 3.1) (n = 22) in comparison to those with
migraine onset after CHC start (3.5 ± 2.1) (n = 26). Menstrually related attacks 
were described as more painful (57.5%), especially in women with migraine onset
before CHC use (72%) (p < 0.02). Comorbidities were rare, except dysmenorrhea.
The majority of migraine attacks in CHC users occur during the hormone-free
interval. Similar as in the natural cycle, hormone-withdrawal migraines in CHC
users are very intense and the response to acute medication is less good,
especially in those women, who developed migraine before CHC use.

INTRODUCTION: The pathogen-associated molecular patterns and the
danger-associated molecular patterns are possibly responsible for the activation 
of the inflammatory process in endometriosis through the activation of toll-like 
receptors (TLRs).
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review was to critically analyze the
findings of published articles on TLRs in endometriosis.
METHODS: The keywords used were "endometriosis" and "toll-like" and the search
was performed in Pubmed, Scielo and Lilacs databases. This study followed the
PRISMA guidelines and the risk of bias of articles was conducted by
Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS).
RESULTS: Overall, the studies analyzed in this review point toward an increased
expression of TLRs two, four and nine in women with endometriosis. Among all
TLRs, TLR4 was the most cited receptor.
CONCLUSION: Despite the evidence demonstrating elevated TLR levels in
endometriosis, the relationship with the disease is still unclear and needs to be
clarified in further studies about innate immune response.

The relationship between endometriosis and subclinical atherosclerosis represents
an emerging topic in women's health, as women with endometriosis are at higher
risk of cardiovascular disease later in life. We investigated metabolic
parameters and indirect endothelial markers related to atherosclerosis, in women 
suffering from stage III/IV of endometriosis compared with women without
endometriosis. The study population comprised 643 women: 92 women (14.3%) with
stage III/IV of endometriosis and 551 (85.7%) without endometriosis. By analyzing
biohumoral parameters we observed a significant increased total cholesterol
(p = 0.01), LDL-C (p = 0.01), triglycerides (p = 0.05) and homocysteinaemia
(p = 0.04), lower vitamin B6 and folate (p = 0.07 and p = 0.03, respectively)
values, and higher high-sensitive C reactive protein (p = 0.05) concentrations in
stage III/IV in comparison to those observed in women without endometriosis.
After adjustment for traditional cardiovascular risk factors, the poorer lipid
profile (total cholesterol, LDL-C), as well as Lipoprotein (a), remained
significantly associated with severity of endometriosis (p = 0.01 and p = 0.03,
respectively). Our findings highlight the role of endometriosis as a
gender-specific cardiovascular risk factor. The clinical relevance of our study
lies in identifying women with stage III/IV of endometriosis at higher risk of
atherosclerotic disease, who could benefit from an early cardiovascular screening
to control future cardiovascular risk.

Human microbiota refers to living microorganisms which colonize our body and
crucially contribute to the metabolism of nutrients and various physiologic
functions. According to recently accumulated evidence, human microbiota dysbiosis
in the genital tract or pelvic cavity could be involved in the pathogenesis
and/or pathophysiology of endometriosis. We aimed to investigate whether the
composition of microbiome is altered in the peritoneal fluid in women with
endometriosis. We recruited 45 women with histological evidence of ovarian
endometrioma and 45 surgical controls without endometriosis. Following the
isolation of extracellular vesicles from peritoneal fluid samples from women with
and without endometriosis, bacterial genomic DNA was sequenced using
next-generation sequencing of the 16S rDNA V3-V4 regions. Diversity analysis
showed significant differences in the microbial community at phylum, class,
order, family, and genus levels between the two groups. The abundance of
Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Streptococcus, and Enhydrobacter significantly
increased while the abundance of Propionibacterium, Actinomyces, and Rothia
significantly decreased in the endometriosis group compared with those in the
control group (p < 0.05). These findings strongly suggest that microbiome
composition is altered in the peritoneal environment in women with endometriosis.
Further studies are necessary to verify whether dysbiosis itself can cause
establishment and/or progression of endometriosis.

The pathogenesis of endometriosis is still controversial, although it is known
that the inflammatory immune response plays a critical role in this process. The 
resolution of inflammation is an active process where the activation of
endogenous factors allows the host tissue to maintain homeostasis. The mechanisms
by which pro-resolving mediators (PRM) act in endometriosis are still little
explored. Thus, this integrative review aims to synthesize the available content 
regarding the role of PRM in endometriosis. Experimental and in vitro studies
with Lipoxin A4 demonstrate a potential inhibitory effect on endometrial lesions'
progression, attenuating pro-inflammatory and angiogenic signals, inhibiting
proliferative and invasive action suppressing intracellular signaling induced by 
cytokines and estradiol, mainly through the FPR2/ALX. Investigations with
Resolvin D1 demonstrated the inhibition of endometrial lesions and decreased
pro-inflammatory factors. Annexin A1 is expressed in the endometrium and is
specifically present in women with endometriosis, although the available studies 
are still inconsistent. Thus, we believe there is a gap in knowledge regarding
the PRM pathways in patients with endometriosis. It is important to note that
these substances' therapeutic potential is evident since the immune and abnormal 
inflammatory responses play an essential role in endometriosis development and
progression.

The maladies affecting the female reproductive tract (FRT) range from infections 
to endometriosis to carcinomas. In vitro models of the FRT play an increasingly
important role in both basic and translational research, since the anatomy and
physiology of the FRT of humans and other primates differ significantly from most
of the commonly used animal models, including rodents. Using organoid culture to 
study the FRT has overcome the longstanding hurdle of maintaining epithelial
phenotype in culture. Both ECM-derived and engineered materials have proved
critical for maintaining a physiological phenotype of FRT cells in vitro by
providing the requisite 3D environment, ligands, and architecture. Advanced
materials have also enabled the systematic study of factors contributing to the
invasive metastatic processes. Meanwhile, microphysiological devices make it
possible to incorporate physical signals such as flow and cyclic exposure to
hormones. Going forward, advanced materials compatible with hormones and
optimised to support FRT-derived cells' long-term growth, will play a key role in
addressing the diverse array of FRT pathologies and lead to impactful new
treatments that support the improvement of women's health. STATEMENT OF
SIGNIFICANCE: : The female reproductive system is a crucial component of the
female anatomy. In addition to enabling reproduction, it has wide ranging
influence on tissues throughout the body via endocrine signalling. This intrinsic
role in regulating normal female biology makes it susceptible to a variety of
female-specific diseases. However, the complexity and human-specific features of 
the reproductive system make it challenging to study. This has spurred the
development of human-relevant in vitro models for helping to decipher the complex
issues that can affect the reproductive system, including endometriosis,
infection, and cancer. In this Review, we cover the current state of in vitro
models for studying the female reproductive system, and the key role biomaterials
play in enabling their development.

STUDY OBJECTIVE: Amenorrhea is a goal of many transgender and gender diverse
adolescent and young adult (TGD AYA) patients on testosterone gender-affirming
hormone therapy (T-GAHT). Breakthrough bleeding can contribute to worsening
gender dysphoria. Our objective was to evaluate breakthrough bleeding in TGD AYA 
on T-GAHT.
DESIGN: IRB-approved retrospective cohort SETTING: : Tertiary-care children's
hospital PARTICIPANTS: : TGD AYA on T-GAHT >1 year INTERVENTIONS: : None,
observational MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: : Presence of, and risk factors for,
breakthrough bleeding RESULTS: : Of the 232 patients who met inclusion criteria, 
one quarter (n=58) had ≥1 episodes of breakthrough bleeding, defined as bleeding 
after >1 year on T-GAHT. In comparing patients with breakthrough bleeding to
those without, there was no significant differences between age of initiation,
body mass index (BMI), race/ethnicity, testosterone type used, use of additional 
menstrual suppression, serum testosterone, or estradiol levels. Patients with
breakthrough bleeding patients were on T-GAHT longer (37.3 ± 17.0 vs. 28.5 ± 14.6
months, p=<0.001) and were more likely to have endometriosis (p=0.049).
Breakthrough bleeding began at a mean of 24.3 ± 17.2 months after T-GAHT
initiation. Of those with breakthrough bleeding, 46 (79.3%) had no known cause,
10 (17.2%) only bled with missed T-GAHT doses, and 2 (3.4%) only bled when
withdrawing from concomitant menstrual suppression. No breakthrough bleeding
management method was found to be superior.
CONCLUSION: Breakthrough bleeding is relatively common (25%) on T-GAHT despite
early amenorrhea. Most patients do not have an identifiable cause. Our data did
not show superiority of any one method for managing breakthrough bleeding on
T-GAHT.

BACKGROUND: Obstructed Müllerian anomalies in adolescents can be grouped into
complete outflow obstruction or unilateral outflow obstruction. The challenge
with unilateral obstructions is that diagnosis can be delayed for weeks to years 
as menstruation occurs normally through the patent side and thus obstruction is
often not initially considered in the differential diagnosis.
CASE: In this case series, we present three unusual and challenging cases of
unilateral Müllerian obstructions in adolescent females along with strategies for
diagnosis and management. Each case involves a unique variation to a recognized
Müllerian anomaly that was initially misdiagnosed leading to a significant delay 
in definitive diagnosis and treatment.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION: These cases highlight that even amongst the well
described Müllerian anomalies there can be unusual variations. Patients that do
not respond to initial management or develop new symptoms should be further
evaluated to confirm the correct diagnosis Tools that may be helpful in making
the correct diagnosis include imaging studies that use contrast dye to better
delineate cavities and their connections, magnetic resonance imaging with a
radiologist experienced in Müllerian anomalies, and an exam under anesthesia. A
definitive diagnosis is critical to the successful management of these conditions
and individualized management plans are required for each patient depending on
their specific anomaly and their preferences for treatment.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to assess the evidence on miRNAs as
biomarkers for the diagnosis of endometriosis, as well as to provide insights
into the challenges and strategies associated with the use of these molecules as 
accessible tools in clinical practice.
METHODS: Systematic review conducted on PubMed®, Latin American and Caribbean
Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), MEDLINE® and Web of Science databases using 
the search terms endometriosis (all fields) AND miRNA (all fields), evaluating
all publication up to May 2019.
RESULTS: Most miRNAs found to be dysregulated in this study were harvested from
tissue samples, which precludes their use as a non-invasive diagnostic test.
However, differential expression of 62 miRNAs was reported in samples that may be
used for non-invasive diagnosis of endometriosis, such as blood, serum and
plasma.
CONCLUSION: Despite the identification of several candidates, studies are
investigatory in nature and have been conducted with small number of samples.
Also, no particular miRNA has been validated for diagnostic purposes so far.
Studies based primarily on biological samples and applicable to translational
research are warranted. Large databases comprising information on sample type and
the use of saliva and vaginal fluid for miRNAs identification may prove essential
to overcome current barriers to diagnosis of endometriosis.

Relationship between magnetic resonance imaging-based classification of
adenomyosis and disease severity.

Author information:

AIMS: The purpose of this study is to first investigate the correlation between
image features and histological findings and the clinical severity of
adenomyosis; second, search for imaging features to assess the type and
locoregional extension of the disease; and finally, discuss the notation of
image-based classification.
METHODS: This paper combines a review of the literature on adenomyosis with a
series of cases who underwent surgery at Nara Medical University Hospital.
RESULTS: Currently, there has been a lack of clear, clinically relevant, and
internationally acceptable definition and histological classification due to its 
diverse phenotype. A number of researchers have attempted to standardize the
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features of adenomyosis. Some researchers have
begun studies that relate the subtype classification using MRI to disease
severity. There is evidence suggesting that diffuse adenomyosis and intrinsic
adenomyosis are correlated with menstrual bleeding, while extrinsic adenomyosis
and coexistence of deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) are related to pelvic
pain. MRI-based classifications that are simple for use in the clinical setting
are beginning to be proposed. However, the reliability and validity of these
classifications have not yet been verified. A simplified notation is required to 
discuss the association between the classification and severity of adenomyosis.
We introduce case reports using the notation of four items necessary for
classification of adenomyosis.
CONCLUSION: There is an urgent need to determine the definitions of terms used in
subtype classification and to create and validate a globally unified notation
that can predict the severity of adenomyosis symptoms.

Demetra Application is a holistic integrated and scalable bioinformatics
web‑based tool designed to assist medical experts and researchers in the process 
of diagnosing endometriosis. The application identifies the most prominent gene
variants and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) causing endometriosis using
the genomic data provided for the patient by a medical expert. The present study 
analyzed >28.000 endometriosis‑related publications using data mining and
semantic techniques aimed towards extracting the endometriosis‑related genes and 
SNPs. The extracted knowledge was filtered, evaluated, annotated, classified, and
stored in the Demetra Application Database (DAD). Moreover, an updated gene
regulatory network with the genes implements in endometriosis was established.
This was followed by the design and development of the Demetra Application, in
which the generated datasets and results were included. The application was
tested and presented herein with whole‑exome sequencing data from seven related
patients with endometriosis. Endometriosis‑related SNPs and variants identified
in genome‑wide association studies (GWAS), whole‑genome (WGS), whole‑exome (WES),
or targeted sequencing information were classified, annotated and analyzed in a
consolidated patient profile with clinical significance information. Probable
genes associated with the patient's genomic profile were visualized using several
graphs, including chromosome ideograms, statistic bars and regulatory networks
through data mining studies with relative publications, in an effort to obtain a 
representative number of the most credible candidate genes and biological
pathways associated with endometriosis. An evaluation analysis was performed on
seven patients from a three‑generation family with endometriosis. All the
recognized gene variants that were previously considered to be associated with
endometriosis were properly identified in the output profile per patient, and by 
comparing the results, novel findings emerged. This novel and accessible
webserver tool of endometriosis to assist medical experts in the clinical
genomics and precision medicine procedure is available at

Uric acid (UA) is the end metabolic product of purine metabolism. Early on, UA
was considered to be a metabolite with a certain antioxidant capacity. As
research has progressed, other properties of UA have been explored, and its
association with many diseases has been found. The association between UA and
kidney disease and cardiovascular disease is well established; however, there is 
still a paucity of reviews on the association between UA and the female
reproductive system. An increasing number of epidemiological studies have shown
elevated serum UA levels in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS),
endometriosis, etc. Additionally, serum UA can be used as a predictor of
pregnancy complications and adverse foetal outcomes. An increasing number of
animal experiments and clinical studies have revealed possible mechanisms related
to the involvement of UA in certain female reproductive disorders: oxidative
stress, chronic inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, etc. This article
reviews the current mainstream mechanisms regarding the pathogenesis of UA and
the role of UA in certain specific female reproductive disorders (direct
involvement in the development of certain diseases or enhancement of other risk
factors) in the hope of contributing to clinical prevention, diagnosis, treatment
and improvement in prognosis.

OBJECTIVE: To explore work performance status in Spanish women with endometriosis
and to identify those endometriosis-related symptoms that potentially contribute 
to the reduced work performance.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
SETTING: Spain.
POPULATION: Women with endometriosis working at enrolment (n = 148).
METHODS: Work performance status was assessed through the Work Role Functioning
Questionnaire (WRFQ). Endometriosis-related symptoms (pelvic pain,
catastrophizing thoughts related to pain, chronic fatigue, sleep quality, mood
status, gastrointestinal discomfort and social support) were also evaluated
through validated scales. Statistical analyses were performed through
multivariate linear regression analyses.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Work performance status.
RESULTS: Median WRFQ score was 72.0, with the lowest scores found in demands
related to worker's needs to manage the workday from beginning to end and those
dynamic and static physical loads required in the conduct of work duties. Severe 
pelvic pain, depressive mood and poorer sleep quality was inversely related to
work performance status (p-values <0.020). Finally, self-perceived social support
was borderline associated with better work performance (p = 0.057). Considered
together, these four psychosocial factors were responsible to explain the 37.9 % 
of the limitations on work performance observed in our study sample.
CONCLUSIONS: Spanish women with endometriosis reported lower WRQF scores
(predominantly in work scheduling and physical demands) in comparison with
previous studies on Spanish healthy adults. Psychosocial factors, including
pelvic pain, sleep quality and depressive mood are related with work performance 
status. Thus, the effectiveness of physical and psychological rehabilitation
programs in work productivity in women with endometriosis should be evaluated in 
the close future.

BACKGROUND: Submucosal fecalith(s) mimicking submucosal tumors of the
gastrointestinal lumen are rare. Moreover, accurate preoperative diagnosis of
these entities is exceedingly difficult, and the mechanism(s) of their formation 
remains unclear.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 40-year-old woman visited the authors' hospital due to lower
abdominal pain and diarrhea. She had previously been treated for endometriosis.
Laboratory investigation revealed increased C-reactive protein levels. Abdominal 
contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed thickening of the appendix wall
and dilation of the small intestine. The patient was diagnosed with paralytic
ileus caused by appendicitis, and interval appendectomy was scheduled. She
underwent laparoscopic-assisted appendectomy after conservative treatment.
Partial cecal resection was selected due to the presence of an elastic mass in
the cecum. The final pathological diagnosis was submucosal fecalith, not
submucosal tumor. On day 5, the patient was discharged without any postoperative 
complications.
CONCLUSIONS: In cases of appendicitis with fecalith(s) that appear as submucosal 
tumor(s) on colonoscopy, submucosal fecalith mimicking submucosal tumor should be
considered in the differential diagnosis.

INTRODUCTION: The prevalence of appendiceal endometriosis ranges from 0.4% to
22%. The carcinoid tumor is the most common neoplasm of the appendix, with
incidence ranging from 0.3% to 0.9%. Appendix lesions develop in up to 22% of
women with deep infiltrative endometriosis. Even though these are most likely
endometriosis, carcinoid tumors should always be considered. The aim of this
review was to assess the prevalence of appendiceal carcinoid tumors and
appendiceal endometriosis in patients undergoing gynecologic surgery, its
association with endometriosis, and related symptoms.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We included retrospective and prospective studies that
assessed women who underwent appendicectomy in the past 20 years for appendiceal 
endometriosis and/or appendix carcinoid tumor confirmed by histological analysis.
Results were reported as relative and absolute frequencies. Due to the
heterogeneity of included studies, a statistical analysis (meta-analysis) was not
performed.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The prevalence of appendiceal endometriosis was 15.2% in
patients who underwent surgery for pelvic endometriosis and 11.4% in those who
underwent benign gynecological surgery. Conversely, carcinoid tumors of the
appendix were present in 2.4% of endometriosis patients and 1.3% of other benign 
gynecological surgeries.
CONCLUSIONS: The rates of carcinoid tumors in patients with endometriosis are the
same as in the general population. Given the risk of a malignant appendiceal
tumor, in all gynecological surgeries, especially those for endometriosis, the
appendix should be inspected and removed if it has an abnormal appearance.

INTRODUCTION: Endometriosis affects 10%-15% of women in reproductive age and may 
cause no-cyclic chronic pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, urinary tract
symptoms, and it is frequently associated with infertility. The peak of incidence
is between 24 and 29 years old and the clinical diagnosis of endometriosis is
generally delayed by 6-7 years. Laparoscopy with surgical biopsies is the "gold
standard" for the diagnosis of endometriosis, with histological verification of
endometrial ectopic glands and/or stroma. However, nowadays two different
non-invasive modalities are routinely used for a presumptive diagnosis:
Transvaginal Ultrasound (TVUS) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A structured search using PubMed was performed starting
from October 2020 and including all relevant original and review articles
published since 2000. The search used the following key word combinations:
"Endometriosis MRI" AND "DIE and MRI" (45); "MRI endometriosis and Pelvic Pain"
OR "Endometriosis and MRI technical development" (296). Ultimately, 87 articles
were deemed relevant and used as the literature basis of this review.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: TVUS represents the first imaging approach for endometriosis 
showing a good diagnostic performance but it is highly operator dependent. MRI is
a second level examination often used in complex cases indeterminate after TVUS
and in pre-operative planning. MRI is considered the best imaging technique for
mapping endometriosis since it provides a more reliable map of deep infiltrating 
endometriosis than physical examination and transvaginal ultrasound. We have
analyzed and described the main forms of endometriosis: adnexal endometriosis,
adenomyosis, peritoneal implants and deep infiltrating endometriosis, showing
their appearance in the two imaging modalities.
CONCLUSIONS: Endometriosis is one of the most common gynecologic disorders
correlated to chronic pelvic pain whose treatment is still today complex and
controversial. In this context, MRI has become an important additional
non-invasive tool to investigate cases of chronic pelvic pain related to deep
infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) with or without neural involvement.

INTRODUCTION: Endometriosis is a chronic gynecological disease that affects
women's quality of life, sexuality, and relationship. Endometriosis-associated
pain plays an essential role in well-being impairment. The present review aimed
to analyze literature about endometriosis-associated pain and quality of life,
sexual health, and quality of the relationship, assessing the role of the
biopsychosocial factors involved and the women's pain experience.
EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Bibliographic research of relevant articles published from 
2015 to 2020 in PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, Scopus, EBSCO, and
Cochrane Library.
EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Endometriosis is associated with impairing all women's
quality of life domains, and pain appears to be the most influential variable.
The pain mechanism is not simple and implies several biological, psychological,
and social factors. Women's sexual health is also impaired, and patients report
dyspareunia, sexual dysfunctions, dissatisfaction, and distress. Partners' sexual
well being is compromised as well. Endometriosis negatively influences
relationship quality, and the illness burden affects both couple members.
CONCLUSIONS: A multidisciplinary team using a couple-centered and a
biopsychosocial approach is crucial to provide appropriate treatment for
endometriosis-associated pain. A better comprehension of all bio-psycho-social
aspects implicated in women's well-being and pain experience needs more research.

Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects approximately 10% of
women of reproductive age. Its clinical manifestations are highly heterogeneous, 
but pelvic pain is the most frequent, causing functional disability. Cyclic or
acyclic chronic pelvic pain (CPP), dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia are frequent
symptoms which often compromise all aspects of the women's quality of life (QoL).
The pathophysiology of endometriosis-related pain is extremely complex and not
always clear. The aim of this literature review is to focus on recent updates on 
the clinical presentation, the pathophysiology and the most important mechanisms 
involved in the pathogenesis of pelvic pain in endometriosis. A literature search
in the Cochrane library, PubMed, Scopus and web of Science databases has been
performed, identifying articles from January 1995 to November 2020. Several
processes seem to be involved in the pathogenesis of pain, but many aspects are
still unclear. Scientific evidence has shown that a correlation between pain
severity and stage of endometriosis rarely occurs, whereas there is a significant
correlation between pain and the presence of deep endometriosis. Onset and
intensity of pain may be due to a complex process involving central sensitization
and peripheral activation of nociceptive pathways as well as dysfunction of the
immune system and of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. A deeper
understanding of these different pathogenetic mechanisms may improve future
treatments in women with painful endometriosis.

Novel biomarkers are needed to accelerate the diagnosis and treatment of
endometriosis. We performed RNA sequencing to explore the expression profiles of 
exosomal circular RNAs (circRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs) and mRNAs in patients with 
ovarian endometriomas, eutopic endometria and normal endometria. Differentially
expressed genes between the different pairs of groups were analyzed and
functionally annotated. Then, miRNA-target RNA pairs were identified, competing
endogenous RNA (ceRNA) scores were calculated, gene expression characteristics
were determined, and these parameters were used to construct an exosomal ceRNA
network. We identified 36 candidate hub genes with high degrees of gene
connectivity. We also topologically analyzed the ceRNA network to obtain a hub
ceRNA network of circRNAs with the highest closeness and ceRNA efficiency. Twelve
genes overlapped between the 36 candidate hub genes and the genes in the hub
ceRNA network. These 12 genes were considered to be exosomal RNA-based
biomarkers, and circ_0026129/miRNA-15a-5p/ATPase H+ transporting V1 subunit A
(ATP6V1A) were at the center of the ceRNA network. By determining the exosomal
RNA expression profiles of endometriosis patients and constructing a
circRNA-associated ceRNA network, these findings provide insight into the
molecular pathways of endometriosis and new resources for its diagnosis and
treatment.

OBJECTIVE: To characterize the long term outcomes, including recurrence of
symptoms, fertility outcomes and need for reoperation, of patients undergoing
surgical management of endometriosis.
METHODS: Population-based cohort study using universal coverage health database
for the province of Ontario, Canada of women aged 18 to 50 undergoing surgery for
endometriosis from April 1, 2002 through March 31, 2018. Surgery was classified
as diagnostic laparoscopy, conservative/uterine preserving (minor or major, with 
and without ovarian preservation) and hysterectomy (with and without ovarian
preservation). Outcomes occurred 30 days after index surgery until the end of the
study period or censoring. Cox Proportional-Hazards regression models were used
to estimate hazard ratios (aHR) between exposures and outcomes adjusted for
confounders.
RESULTS: A total of 84,885 women (3.2% diagnostic laparoscopy, 25.4% minor
conservative surgery, 33.6% major conservative with ovarian preservation, 2.5%
major conservative without ovarian preservation, 25.5% hysterectomy with ovarian 
preservation, and 9.9% hysterectomy without ovarian preservation) were included
in the cohort and followed for a median of 10 (IQR:6-13) years. In the first
postoperative year, women who underwent diagnostic laparoscopy were significantly
more likely to require repeat surgery (aHR1.68, 95% CI: 1.51, 1.87), while those 
having major conservative surgery were significantly less likely to require
repeat surgery (with ovarian preservation aHR 0.44, 95% CI: 0.41, 0.48 and
without ovarian preservation aHR 0.05, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.09). Among women who did
not receive repeat surgery in the first year, those having diagnostic laparoscopy
(aHR 0.85, 95% CI: 0.76, 0.95) and major conservative surgery without ovarian
preservation were less likely to undergo repeat surgery (aHR 0.12, 95% CI: 0.09, 
0.18) than those who initially had minor surgery. Compared to those initially
having minor surgery, patients who underwent other treatment modalities were less
likely to undergo hysterectomy (diagnostic laparoscopy aHR 0.85, 95%CI 0.75,
0.96, major with ovarian preservation aHR 0.60, 95% CI: 0.57, 0.64, and major
without ovarian preservation aHR 0.05 95% CI: 0.03, 0.08). Following minor and
major conservative with ovarian preservation surgery, 38.6% and 33.3% of patients
sought an infertility consult, respectively. By five years after index surgery,
29.4% of patients who had minor conservative surgery and 20.7% of major
conservative with ovarian preservation surgery patients had given birth at least 
once.
COMMENT: Our study suggests that few endometriosis patients who undergo
hysterectomy require repeat surgery; however, up to 1 in 4 who undergo minor
surgery and 1 in 5 who undergo major conservative surgery with ovarian
preservation require additional endometriosis surgery. Up to 1 in 3 patients who 
had uterine sparing endometriosis surgery subsequently seek infertility
assessment. These findings may inform preoperative counseling with regards to
recurrence of symptoms, fertility outcomes and need for reoperation for women
seeking surgical management of endometriosis. Future studies should consider
outcomes of patient satisfaction and quality of life under the current practices

An increased number of highly active regulatory T cells (Tregs) and macrophages
has been found in peritoneal fluid from women with endometriosis. Here, we show
that the level of Tregs-derived soluble fibrinogen-like protein 2 (sFGL2)
increases in the peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis. Higher expression 
of FGL2 and its receptor CD32B is observed in eutopic endometrium and ectopic
tissues. The production of sFGL2 in Tregs may be enhanced by several cytokines.
sFGL2 selectively induces pro-repair macrophage polarization mainly through the
activation of the SHP2-ERK1/2-STAT3 signaling pathway, and the suppression of the
NF-κB signaling pathway. Furthermore, sFGL2 induces a much higher level of
metallothionein (MT) expression that in turn facilitates pro-repair macrophages
polarization. sFGL2-induced pro-repair macrophages promote Th2 and Tregs
differentiation, creating a positive feedback loop. These findings suggest that
sFGL2 secreted by Tregs skews macrophages toward a pro-repair phenotype via
SHP2-ERK1/2-STAT3 signaling pathway, which is involved in the progression of
endometriosis.

STUDY OBJECTIVE: To describe cases of conversion from gynecological laparoscopy
to open surgery, assess risk factors for conversion and conversion outcomes.
DESIGN: A retrospective case-control study SETTING: Tertiary referral hospital in
Melbourne, Australia PATIENTS: Eighty-five cases of conversion from laparoscopy
to laparotomy and 170 controls matched by age, surgical date and gynecological
unit from 2006-2017.
INTERVENTIONS: Demographic, clinical and surgical data was collected and compared
between the study groups. Logistic regression was performed to identify
preoperative and intraoperative risk factors for conversion.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Rate of conversion during the study period was
0.7%. The most common indication for conversion was unexpected surgical
complexity (67% of cases) which included severe adhesive disease, specimen size, 
severe pathology and inadequate views. Factors that were significantly associated
with risk of conversion in multivariate analysis were previous pelvic
inflammatory disease (aOR 5.16 (1.35-19.71 95% CI, p=.02), previous open surgery 
(aOR 3.62 (1.52-8.58) 95% CI, p<.01), history of endometriosis (aOR 2.96
(1.17-7.50 95% CI, p=.02) and elevated body mass index (aOR 1.07 (1.01-1.13) 95% 
CI, p=0.02). As compared to current surgery for endometriosis, odds of conversion
were higher in surgeries for emergency indications (aOR 5.40 (1.53-18.98) 95% CI,
p<.01), uterine pathologies (aOR 3.34 (1.10-10.12) 95% CI, p=.03) and adnexal
pathologies (aOR 2.76 (1.19-6.40) 95% CI, p=.02). With the inclusion of
intraoperative factors, surgical adhesions were also found to be associated with 
conversion (aOR 3.19 (1.30-7.85) 95% CI, p=.01). Most skilled laparoscopic
surgeon level as defined by the Australasian Gynaecological Endoscopy and Surgery
Society (AGES) was not associated with conversion risk. Conversion to laparotomy 
was associated with a higher rate of intra-operative and post-operative
complications and prolonged length of stay.
CONCLUSION: Conversion to laparotomy is a rare but very important clinical
outcome measure of laparoscopic surgery. Understanding the factors contributing
to conversion and peri-operative outcomes may help clinicians to identify and
counsel patients before surgery and to reduce surgical morbidity.

STUDY OBJECTIVE: Chronic endometritis (CE) which often presents asymptomatically,
is associated with recurrent pregnancy loss, recurrent implantation failure after
in-vitro-fertilization, and endometriosis. Data connecting CE with Fallopian
tubal occlusion are limited. The aim was to assess a potential association of CE 
defined by the presence of CD138 positive plasma cells in endometrial tissue
samples with Fallopian tube patency and other factors for infertility including
endometriosis, adenomyosis and hydrosalpinges.
DESIGN: Prospective, monocentral pilot study.
SETTING: Tertiary care center.
PATIENTS: A cohort of 100 infertile women were enrolled from July 2019 to
December 2020.
INTERVENTIONS: Hysteroscopy with endometrial biopsy and laparoscopy with
chromopertubation.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: CE was found in thirteen women (13.0%) and was
associated with endometriosis (p=.034) and unilateral/bilateral Fallopian tube
blockage (p=.013). In women with endometriosis, the mean number of CD138-positive
cells was positively correlated with the rASRM score (r= .302, p= .028). In a
binary regression model, the presence of a hydrosalpinx on one or both sides
(odds ratio 15.308, 95% CI: 1.637-143.189; p= .017) and the finding of CE in the 
endometrial tissue sample (odds ratio 5.273, 95% CI: 1.257-22.116, p= .023) were 
significantly associated with Fallopian tubal occlusion.
CONCLUSION: CE was significantly associated with blockage of the Fallopian tubes 
and endometriosis. Endometriosis stage was associated with the number of
CD138-positive cells in endometrial biopsies.

OBJECTIVE: Toll-like receptors (TLRs, as members of the innate immune system) are
expressed in the human endometrium and their aberrant regulation and expression
are involved in the pathogenesis of endometrial diseases. This study is aimed at 
evaluation of TLR3 signaling pathway genes and its genetic changes in
endometriosis patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 83 endometriosis
patients and 93 healthy fertile women and PCR was performed in blood-derived DNA 
for detection of SNP of TLR3. Also, ectopic (EC) and eutopic (EU) endometrial
biopsies were obtained from endometriosis patients (n = 20), as well as
endometrium from healthy women (n = 16, CE). Q-PCR was performed for
determination of mRNA expression level of TLR3 signaling pathway genes (TLR3,
TICAM, NF-kB1A, CXCL10, IRF3, IFN-B1, IL-6 and IL-8). Also, serum protein levels 
of TLR3, IFN-β, IL-6 and IL-8 were determined using ELISA.
RESULTS: The mRNA expression levels of TLR3, NF-kB1A, IFN-B1, IRF3, TICAM1, IL-6 
and IL-8 were significantly higher in EU compared to ectopic ones and also
compared to CE. SNPs frequency (rs3775291 and rs3775290) was not significantly
different between patients and controls. Serum protein levels of TLR3, IFN-β,
IL-6 and IL-8 were significantly increased in endometriosis patients.
CONCLUSION: Significant changes were observed in the expression of IL-6 and IL-8 
cytokines and other genes in TLR3 cascade in diseased EU, demonstrating that EU
similarly to EC is in an intensive inflammatory state. These fundamental
alterations in the concept of immune response in EU may lead to its activation,
escapes from apoptosis, and displaced implantation of the endometrium.

STUDY OBJECTIVE: To assess individual changes of deep dyspareunia (DDyspareunia) 
six months after laparoscopic nerve-sparing complete excision of endometriosis,
with or without robotic assistance.
METHODS: This preplanned interdisciplinary observational study with a
retrospective analysis of intervention enrolled 126 consecutive women who
underwent surgery between January 2018 and September 2019 at a private
specialized center. Demographics, medical history and surgery details were
recorded systematically. DDyspareunia (primary outcome), dysmenorrhea and acyclic
pelvic pain were assessed on self-reported 11-point numeric rating scales both
preoperatively and at six-month follow-up. Cases with poor prognosis in relation 
to dyspareunia were described individually in greater detail.
RESULTS: Preoperative DDyspareunia showed weak correlation with dysmenorrhea (rho
= .240; P = .014) and pelvic pain (rho = .260; P = .004). Although DDyspareunia
improved significantly (P < .001) by 3 points or more in 75.8% (95%CI: 64.7-86.2)
and disappeared totally in 59.7% of cases (95%CI:47.8-71.6), individual analysis 
identified different patterns of response. The probability of a preoperative
moderate/severe DDyspareunia worsening more than 2 points was 4.8% (95%CI:
0.0-10.7) and the probability of a woman with no DDyspareunia developing "de
novo" moderate or severe DDyspareunia was 7.7% (95%CI: 1.8-15.8) and 5.8% (95%CI:
0.0-13.0), respectively. In a qualitative analysis, several conditions were
hypothesized to impact the post-operative DDyspareunia response; these included
adenomyosis, mental health disorders, lack of hormone therapy after surgery,
colporrhaphy, nodule excision in ENZIAN B compartment (uterosacral
ligament/parametrium), the rectovaginal septum or the retrocervical region.
CONCLUSION: Endometriosis surgery provides significant improvement in
DDyspareunia. However, patients should be alerted about the possibility of
unsatisfactory results.

STUDY QUESTION: Is there any change in the distribution of microvilli and
microtubules in the apical endometria of women with adenomyosis?
SUMMARY ANSWER: We observed microvilli damage in the apical endometria and an
axonemal alteration characterized by abnormal distribution of longitudinal
bundles of microtubules within microvilli in women with adenomyosis.
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Human adenomyosis has a negative impact on female
fertility. Abnormal utero-tubal sperm transport, tissue inflammation and toxic
effect of chemical mediators have been proposed as contributing factors.
Inflammation-induced damage of mucosal cilia in the Fallopian tube has been
reported. However, information on inflammation-induced damage of microvilli on
the apical endometrial cells and its core bundles of microtubules in adenomyosis 
remains unknown.
STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This is a prospective cohort study with subjects
undergoing laparoscopic surgery or hysterectomy for clinical indication and
evaluations of endometrial biopsy samples in two academic university hospitals.
During the period between March 2015 and December 2018, endometrial biopsy
samples were prospectively collected from 15 control women and 45 women with
adenomyosis for immunohistochemical analysis and a separate cohort of 10 control 
women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia Grade 3 (CIN3) and 20 women with
adenomyosis for analysis by immunohistochemistry and transmission electron
microscopy (TEM).
PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: For immunohistochemical study,
endometrial biopsy samples were prospectively collected from 15 control women
with fibroids, 25 women with focal adenomyosis and 20 women with diffuse
adenomyosis after surgery. The diagnosis of fibroid and adenomyosis was made
clinically by transvaginal ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging and
confirmed by histology. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed
retrospectively using antibody against CD68 (marker of macrophages) in
endometrial biopsy specimens of women with and without adenomyosis. TEM was
performed with the apical endometria collected from a separate cohort of 10
control women with CIN3 and 20 women with focal and diffuse adenomyosis for the
identification of any change in the distribution of microvilli and longitudinal
bundles of microtubules within microvilli.
MAIN RESULTS AND ROLE OF CHANCE: Comparing to control endometria and
contralateral side, tissue infiltration of macrophages (Mφ) in the endometria was
significantly higher on the ipsilateral side of focal adenomyosis (P = 0.02 and
P = 0.03, respectively) and anterior/posterior walls of diffuse adenomyosis
(P = 0.01 for both). In a subgroup analysis of patients with focal adenomyosis
with and without symptoms, the endometria of symptomatic women displayed a
tendency of higher Mφ infiltration on the ipsilateral side than in asymptomatic
women (P = 0.07). Comparing to contralateral side endometria of symptomatic
women, Mφ infiltration was significantly higher in the endometria of symptomatic 
women collected from the ipsilateral side of focal adenomyosis (P = 0.03). We
found a significantly less tissue infiltration of Mφ in the endometria of women
with CIN3 than that in endometria of women with focal adenomyosis. TEM analysis
showed that number of microvilli in the endometria was significantly decreased on
the ipsilateral side (P = 0.003) comparing to that on the contralateral side of
focal adenomyosis. The Chi-squared test indicated that cases with abnormal
(disruption in the normal arrangement of 9 peripheral pairs + 1 central pair)
microtubules (MT) were significantly higher in women with adenomyosis than in
cases with normal patterns (P = 0.0016). While contralateral side displayed
significantly less abnormal MT (P = 0.0002), ipsilateral side of focal
adenomyosis showed significantly higher abnormal MT (P = 0.0164) comparing to
normal patterns. Cases with symptomatic adenomyosis showed significantly higher
abnormal MT than normal MT (P = 0.0004). An axonemal alteration characterized by 
abnormal structural distribution of microtubules within microvilli in the apical 
endometria in response to endometrial inflammation may be involved in adverse
reproductive outcome in women with adenomyosis.
LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The average age of women in this study was high
that may be associated with overall decline in fertility regardless of the
presence or absence of adenomyosis or endometriosis. We collected endometrial
biopsy samples from two completely separate cohorts of women for analysis by
immunohiostochemistry and TEM. We need future follow-up study with increased
sample size and from the same patients to precisely clarify the mechanistic link 
between axonemal alteration and negative fertility outcome.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our current findings may have some biological
implication to better understand the endometrial epithelial biology and pathology
in women with adenomyosis and may open the avenue for future study in other
reproductive diseases. The ultra-structural abnormalities of microvilli and
microtubules in the apical endometria in response to tissue inflammatory reaction
may clarify the possible association between negative fertility outcome and
adenomyosis. Our findings may be clinically useful during counseling with
symptomatic patients with adenomyosis desiring pregnancy.

Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels play prominent roles in ion
homeostasis by their ability to control cation influx. Mouse placentation is
governed by the processes of trophoblast proliferation, invasion,
differentiation, and fusion, all of which require calcium signaling. Although
certain TRP channels have been shown to contribute to maternal-fetal transport of
magnesium and calcium, a role for TRP channels in specific trophoblast functions 
has been disregarded. Using qRT-PCR and in situ hybridisation, the
spatio-temporal expression pattern of TRP channels in the mouse placenta across
gestation (E10.5-E18.5) was assessed. Prominent expression was observed for
Trpv2, Trpm6, and Trpm7. Calcium microfluorimetry in primary trophoblast cells
isolated at E14.5 of gestation further revealed the functional activity of TRPV2 
and TRPM7. Finally, comparing TRP channels expression in mouse trophoblast stem
cells (mTSCs) and mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC) confirmed the specific
expression of TRPV2 during placental development. Moreover, TRP channel
expression was similar in mTSCs compared to primary trophoblasts and validate
mTSC as a model to study TRP channels in placental development. Collectivity, our
results identify a specific spatio-temporal TRP channel expression pattern in
trophoblasts, suggesting a possible involvement in regulating the process of
placentation.

BACKGROUND: Endometriosis is the presence of tissue similar to that of the
endometrium outside the uterine cavity and is the most common cause of chronic
pelvic pain. Current non-surgical treatments such as non-steroidal
anti-inflammatories, oral contraceptive pills and hormonal treatments have
limited effectiveness, and the side effect profile is bothersome. This study will
evaluate the efficacy of Gynoclear™ by change in endometriosis-related pain based
on the Endometriosis Pain Daily Diary (EPPD) scores.
METHODS: This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial will recruit a
minimum of 90 adult participants across Australia who have a laparoscopic
visualisation/confirmation of endometriosis in the last 5 years and have current 
moderate or greater pelvic pain. Participants will be randomly allocated in a 1:1
ratio to receive either Gynoclear™ (active) or placebo. Gyncolear's active
ingredients are Carthamus tinctorius (Safflower), Cinnamomum cassia (Chinese
cinnamon), Poria cocos (Hoelen), Paeonia suffriticosa (Tree peony), Paeonia
lactiflora (Peony) and Salvia miltiorrhiza (Red sage). Participants are asked to 
complete a total of 5 months' worth of pain diary entries via the EPDD v3,
including 1-month screening, 2-month treatment period and 1-month post-treatment 
follow-up. The primary outcome variable is change in endometriosis-related pain
based on the EPDD v3 scores. Secondary outcomes include change in health-related 
quality of life via the Endometriosis Health Profile (EHP-30), SF-12 and EQ-5D
scores as well as changes in rescue analgesic usage, dyspareunia and fatigue via 
the EPDD.
DISCUSSION: This study will determine the safety and efficacy of Gynoclear™ to
reduce the severity and duration of non-cyclical pelvic pain, dysmenorrhoea,
dyspareunia and other symptoms of endometriosis. Study outcomes will be of
interest to health professionals and members of the public who suffer from
endometriosis.

OBJECTIVES: Endometriosis-associated ovarian cancer (EAOC) patients show
different clinical characteristics compared with non-EAOC patients. However, a
few studies are focused on the imaging characteristics of EAOC until now. We
assessed MRI characteristics in differentiating EAOC and non-EAOC.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed clinical and MRI characteristics from 54
patients with 67 lesions diagnosed with primary epithelial ovarian carcinoma at
the Third Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University between January
2012 and October 2020. We studied MRI findings such as maximum diameter,
morphology, configuration, locularity, features of mural nodules,
lymphadenopathy, peritoneal implants, the presence of hyperintensity on T1WI, and
hypointensity on T2WI. We also studied the clinical characteristics. Significant 
MRI variables in univariate analysis were selected for subsequent multivariate
regression analysis. This study evaluated the diagnostic performance of the
significant MRI variables in univariate analysis.
RESULTS: We found that the patients with EAOC, compared with those with non-EAOC,
were younger, more unilateral, and had earlier FIGO stage. Univariate analysis
revealed that morphology, locularity, growth pattern of mural nodules, and
hypointensity on T2WI were factors that significantly differed between EAOC and
non-EAOC. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, locularity and
hypointensity on T2WI were independent predictors to distinguish EAOC from
non-EAOC.
CONCLUSIONS: EAOC typically presented as a unilocular mass with hypointensity on 
T2WI in cystic components. MRI could help distinguish EAOC from non-EAOC.
ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: MRI is a promising tool for preoperative diagnosis of
EAOC.

Aim: To assess health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients with benign
gynecological disorders. Materials & methods: Prospective 2-year follow-up with
the 15D HRQoL-instrument of 311 women treated in Helsinki-area hospitals in
2012-2013. Results: The initially impaired HRQoL regarding excretion, discomfort 
and symptoms, and vitality and sexual activity improved after treatment. However,
only sexual activity reached similar levels as in the general population.
Treatment of endometriosis, fibroids and polyps resulted in best and that of
unspecific pelvic pain and bleeding disorders in worst HRQoL scores. Results were
independent of hospital size. Conclusion: The impaired HRQoL dimensions were
improved by treatment but HRQoL still remained poorer than in the general female 
population. Treatment of unspecific pelvic pain and bleeding disorders needs
further evaluation.

plain-language-summary: Tweetable abstract Benign gynecological conditions
markedly impact women’s quality of life including physical, sexual and mental
well-being. Two-year follow-up of patients in this new study found quality of
life to be partly improved by treatment, but was still lower than in the general 
female population.

BACKGROUND: Catamenial pneumothorax is characterized by spontaneous recurring
pneumothorax during menstruation, which is a common clinical manifestation of
thoracic endometriosis syndrome. There are still controversies about its
pathogenesis.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 43-year-old woman with a history of endometriosis came to
our hospital due to recurring pneumothorax during menstruation. Uniportal
Video-assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery (VATS) exploration was performed on the eve 
of menstruating. We thoroughly explored the diaphragm, visceral and parietal
pleura: The lung surface was scattered with yellowish-brown implants; no bullae
were found; multiple diaphragmatic defects were found on the dome. And
surprisingly, we caught a fascinating phenomenon: Bubbles were slipping into
pleural cavity through diaphragmatic defects. We excised the diaphragmatic
lesions and wedge resected the right upper lung lesion; cleared the deposits and 
flushed the thoracic cavity with pure iodophor. Diaphragmatic lesions confirmed
the presence of endometriosis, and interestingly enough, microscopically,
endometrial cells were shedding with impending menses. After a series of
intraoperative operations and postoperative endocrine therapy, the disease did
not recur after a period of follow-up.
CONCLUSION: We have witnessed the typical signs of catamenial pneumothorax at the
accurate timing: Not only observed the process of gas migration macroscopically, 
but also obtained pathological evidence of diaphragmatic periodic perforation
microscopically, which is especially precious and confirms the existing theory
that retrograde menstruation leads to diaphragmatic endometriosis, and the
diaphragmatic fenestration is obtained due to the periodic activities of ectopic 
endometrium.

Autophagy is a conserved fundamental cellular process with a primary function of 
catabolizing harmful or surplus cellular contents such as protein aggregates,
dysfunctional/long-lived organelles, intracellular pathogens, and storage
nutrients. An increasing body of evidence reveals that basal autophagy is
essential for maintaining endometrial homeostasis and mediating
endometrial-specific functions, including menstrual cycle, embryo implantation,
and decidualization. However, perturbed levels of autophagy can lead to severe
endometrial pathologies, including endometriosis, endometrial hyperplasia,
endometrial cancer, adenomyosis, and leiomyoma. This review highlights the most
recent findings on the activity, regulation, and function of autophagy in
endometrium physiology and pathology. Understanding the mechanistic roles of
autophagy in endometrium homeostasis and disease is key to developing novel
therapeutic strategies for endometrium-related infertility and malignancies.

Endometriosis in adolescence represents a specific variant of the disease with
its own characteristics and, in some cases, even a possibly different
pathogenesis. It has its own clinical presentation, diagnostic and therapeutic
modalities. The condition is not rare as once thought and certainly deserves
attention in view of increasing evidence of its likely progressive nature.
Numerous theories for Its pathogenesis have been formulated and they have been
divided into two main categories: the 'in-situ' and the 'transplantation'
hypotheses. Clinical manifestations include as the prevailing symptom a
persistent chronic pelvic pain, despite medical treatment, manifested under
various forms: dysmenorrhea, acyclic chronic pain, acute abdominal pain and
migraines. These symptoms can substantially affect the quality of life on an
adolescent. At histopathology, adolescent endometriosis is characterized by a
high proportion of subtle, clear, red or vesicular implants and by the rarity of 
deep nodules. Frequently, the picture includes ovarian endometriomas. In some
adolescent girls, lesions may regress or even disappear, probably through immune 
suppression; in others, chronic stress, unhealthy diet or lifestyle such as
high-fat diet, may accelerate lesional progression and cause symptoms.
Classically, management of adolescent endometriosis has been centered on attempts
to treat dysmenorrhea; today both medical and surgical modalities have the
potential to improve quality of life, alleviate symptoms, prevent the development
of more severe disease and minimize risks for future fertility in adolescents.
Nonetheless, at present, medical treatments are considered the first line of
interventions in treating young women.

A pregnant woman with acute abdomen.

[Article in English, Norwegian]

Torkildsen CF, Sande RK, Kirial K, Andersen ME, Thomsen LCV.

BACKGROUND: Acute abdomen in pregnancy is challenging. The presentation of
symptoms and available diagnostic tools are directed and complicated by the
pregnancy. A rare cause of acute abdomen in pregnancy requiring immediate
intervention is presented.
CASE PRESENTATION: A primiparous woman with 34 weeks of uncomplicated pregnancy
presented with acute onset of abdominal pain, no signs of labour or vaginal
bleeding, blood pressure 127/100, and pulse 90. No fetal distress was indicated
by cardiotocography or abdominal ultrasound, while large amounts of
intra-abdominal free fluid were identified. The clinical examination revealed
free intra-abdominal fluid, which combined with the intense pain prompted an
emergency caesarean section on vital indication with removal of intra-abdominal
blood, immediate delivery, and manual compression of the aorta. No signs of
placental abruption or rupture of the uterine wall were identified. The bleeding,
originating from a spontaneous rupture of the left uterine vein, was halted by
vessel ligation. Although haemodynamically stable, the woman's estimated blood
loss was 4700 millilitres. The child remained for ten days in the NICU owing to
prematurity.
INTERPRETATION: A total of 100 case reports of acute spontaneous haemoperitoneum 
during pregnancy have been published. The underlying pathophysiology is
undetermined, but possible risk factors include nulliparity, endometriosis
causing extrauterine bleeding, and varicose veins. The condition requires
immediate intervention, as morbidity and mortality rates for mother and fetus are
high.

STUDY QUESTION: What is the sensitivity and the specificity of preoperative
transvaginal ultrasound with bowel preparation (TVUS-BP) compared to diagnostic
laparoscopy (DL) for the identification of ovarian and deep sites of
endometriosis?
SUMMARY ANSWER: DL was able to detect retrocervical, ovarian, and bladder
endometriosis with similar sensitivity and specificity as TVUS-BP, whereas for
vaginal and rectosigmoid endometriosis, DL had lower sensitivity and specificity 
than TVUS-BP.
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: TVUS-BP is a non-invasive examination with good accuracy
for diagnosing ovarian and deep endometriosis. DL is expensive and can lead to
surgical complications.
STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This prospective study included a total of 120
consecutive patients who underwent surgery for suspected endometriosis with
preoperative imaging (TVUS-BP), including a video of the laparoscopic procedure, 
between March 2017 and September 2019.
PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Two radiologists performed preoperative
TVUS-BP using the same protocol for diagnosing endometriosis. Two surgeons, who
were blinded to the results of the preoperative imaging and clinical data,
reviewed the surgical videos from the entry of the abdominal cavity until the
surgeon finalized a complete and systematic review prior to beginning any
dissection (considered as a DL). A data sheet was used by surgeons and
radiologists to record the sites and size of disease involvement, the American
Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) stage, and the Enzian score. The
surgical visualization of endometriosis lesions that were confirmed by
histological analysis was the gold standard.
MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: DL was able to detect retrocervical,
ovarian, and bladder endometriosis with similar sensitivity and specificity as
TVUS-BP. DL was not able to detect vaginal endometriosis (sensitivity and
specificity 0%): this is compared to a sensitivity and specificity of 85.7% and
99.1%, respectively with the utilization of a preoperative TVUS-BP. In addition, 
DL was notably poor at detecting rectosigmoid endometriosis, with a sensitivity
of 3.7-5.6%, and this compares to 96.3% sensitivity with utilization of a
preoperative TVUS (P < 0.001). For the ASRM stage, TVUS-BP results were highly
correlated with the degree of endometriosis and pouch of Douglas (POD)
obliteration (weighted Kappa of 0.867 and 0.985, respectively). For the Enzian
score, there was a substantial correlation between TVUSP-BP and DL for
compartment A (weighted Kappa = 0.827), compartment B (weighted Kappa = 0.670),
and compartment C (weighted kappa = 0.814).
LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The number of participants included may be a
limitation in this study and, as the evaluators were blinded to the physical
exam, the DL accuracy could be underestimated. As biopsies of pelvic organs were 
obtained only if there was a suspicion of endometriosis, the gold standard was
not always applicable. This aspect could underestimate the prevalence of lesions 
and overestimate the sensitivity and the specificity of both the TVUS-BP and the 
DL.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Preoperative TVUS-BP was accurate in
identifying all sites of ovarian and deep endometriosis that were evaluated. It
had significantly higher sensitivity than DL in detecting rectosigmoid
endometriosis and predicting intraoperative ASRM staging and the Enzian score.
These results suggest that TVUS-BP can replace DL for the diagnosis and treatment
planning for patients with ovarian and deep endometriosis.

RESEARCH QUESTION: Presence of endometrial fluid (EF) is a poorly understood
pathology and remains a challenge for clinicians, as very little data exists to
explain its consequences and treatment. Our objective was to investigate risk
factors for EF during IVF.
DESIGN: This retrospective cohort study included all women with a freeze all
embryos cycle (FAE) for EF between 2010 and 2016 at a university-affiliated
private IVF center. Controls (2:1) were randomly selected out of the database of 
our fresh autologous IVF cycles during the same period. Main outcome measures
were possible risk factors for EF, comprising polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS),
ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), previous pelvic or endometrial surgery 
(polypectomy or synechia removal), cesarean section, myomas and severe
endometriosis. A logistic regression model was used to assess independent risk
factors for EF.
RESULTS: Out of 9000 IVF cycles, 1204 were FAE cycles, among which we identified 
86 EF cases. We then selected 171 controls. Independent risk factors for presence
of EF were a history of previous myomectomy (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 19.77,
95%CI [4.01-97.53]), severe endometriosis (aOR 5.97, 95%CI [2.09-17.05]), PCOS
(aOR 5.72, 95%CI [2.66-12.33]) and previous cesarean section (aOR 5.17, 95%CI
[1.84-14.49]).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results are not only confirming the association between PCOS,
severe endometriosis, previous cesarean procedure and EF, but also reporting for 
the first time an association between previous myomectomy and EF.

INTRODUCTION: Surgical management of Diaphragmatic and thoracic endometriosis
(DTE) is still controversial, a thoracic or an abdominal approach can be
proposed.
METHODS: We conducted a multicentric retrospective study in 8 thoracic,
gynecology or digestive surgery units in 5 French university hospitals. The main 
objective was to review the current management of DTE.
RESULTS: 50 patients operated for DTE from 2010 to 2017 were included: 26 with a 
thoracic approach and 24 with an abdominal approach. Preoperative pelvic
endometriosis (PE) concerned 25 patients. In 38 patients, DTE diagnosis was made 
on clinical symptoms (pneumothorax (n = 19), chronic or catamenial chest pain
(n = 18) or hemopneumothorax (n = 1)). Median time from onset of symptoms to
diagnosis was 47 months (0-212). PE surgery concurrently occurred in 22 patients.
We report diaphragmatic nodules, pleuropulmonary nodules and diaphragmatic
perforations in 42, 5 and 22 women respectively. Lesions were right-sided in 45
patients. Nodules were destructed in 12 cases and resected in 38 cases. When a
diaphragmatic reconstruction was needed (n = 31), a simple suture was performed
in 26 patients, while 5 patients needed a mesh repair. Pleural symphysis was
performed for all patients who received a thoracic approach. DTE resection was
considered complete in 46 patients. Three patients had severe 30-days
complications of DTE surgery. Median follow-up was 20 months (range 1-69).
Recurrence occurred in 10 patients.
CONCLUSION: The results emphasize the importance of systematically looking for
chest pain in patients suffering from PE and underline the lack of a standardized
procedure and treatment in DTE.

Endometriosis, a common gynecological disease, causes chronic pelvic pain and
infertility in women of reproductive age. Due to the limited efficacy of current 
therapies, a critical need exists to develop new treatments for endometriosis.
Inflammatory dysfunction, instigated by abnormal macrophage (MΦ) function,
contributes to disease development and progression. However, the fundamental role
of the heterogeneous population of peritoneal MΦ and their potential druggable
functions is uncertain. Here we report that GATA6-expressing large peritoneal MΦ 
(LPM) were increased in the peritoneal cavity following lesion induction. This
was associated with increased cytokine and chemokine secretion in the peritoneal 
fluid (PF), as well as MΦ infiltration, vascularization and innervation in
endometriosis-like lesions (ELL). Niclosamide, an FDA-approved anti-helminthic
drug, was effective in reducing LPM number, but not small peritoneal MΦ (SPM), in
the PF. Niclosamide also inhibits aberrant inflammation in the PF, ELL, pelvic
organs (uterus and vagina) and dorsal root ganglion (DRG), as well as MΦ
infiltration, vascularization and innervation in the ELL. PF from ELL mice
stimulated DRG outgrowth in vitro, whereas the PF from niclosamide-treated ELL
mice lacked the strong stimulatory nerve growth response. These results suggest
LPM induce aberrant inflammation in endometriosis promoting lesion progression
and establishment of the inflammatory environment that sensitizes peripheral
nociceptors in the lesions and other pelvic organs, leading to increased
hyperalgesia. Our findings provide the rationale for targeting LPM and their
functions with niclosamide and its efficacy in endometriosis as a new

Over the past 20 years, important relationships between the microbiota and human 
health have emerged. A link between alterations of microbiota composition
(dysbiosis) and cancer development has been recently demonstrated. In particular,
the composition and the oncogenic role of intestinal bacterial flora has been
extensively investigated in preclinical and clinical studies focusing on
gastrointestinal tumors. Overall, the development of gastrointestinal tumors is
favored by dysbiosis as it leads to depletion of antitumor substances (e.g.,
short-chain fatty acids) produced by healthy microbiota. Moreover, dysbiosis
leads to alterations of the gut barrier, promotes a chronic inflammatory status
through activation of toll-like receptors, and causes metabolic and hormonal
dysregulations. However, the effects of these imbalances are not limited to the
gastrointestinal tract and they can influence gynecological tumor carcinogenesis 
as well. The purpose of this Review is to provide a synthetic update about the
mechanisms of interaction between gut microbiota and the female reproductive
tract favoring the development of neoplasms. Furthermore, novel therapeutic
approaches based on the modulation of microbiota and their role in gynecological 
oncology are discussed.

In order to further explore the potential pharmacological activity of astaxanthin
(AST), network pharmacological approaches were employed in this work to
systematically investigate its affinity targets, perturbed signaling pathways,
and related disease applications. First, potential targets were captured based on
AST chemical structure information. Enrichment analysis was then performed using 
bioinformatics tools to predict the biological processes and diseases in which
AST targets are involved. The results suggest that AST is involved in steroid
hormone metabolism, and the regulation of glucocorticoids may be one of the
potential mechanisms of its known therapeutic effects on depression and insulin
resistance. Molecular docking experiments confirmed that AST can form stable
binding to several key nodes (SRD5A2, STS, AKR1C2, HSD11B1, and CYP17A1) in
steroid hormone biosynthesis. More importantly, the molecular targets of AST were
the most significantly associated with endometriosis. Functionally, grouped
analysis of key therapeutic nodes was carried out by establishing the interaction
network between drug targets and disease targets. While exerting inflammatory
effects, the regulation of estrogen and other semiochemicals by targeting steroid
metabolism may be the biological basis for the potential treatment of
endometriosis with AST. This work provides a theoretical basis for further
exploring the pharmacological mechanisms of AST and development of new
therapeutic applications. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: In this study, systematic
pharmacological methods were used to identify the potential therapeutic effects
and associated mechanisms of astaxanthin, providing a bioinformatics basis for
further exploration of astaxanthin's new pharmacological properties in foods.

Skin endometriosis is a rare disease with variable clinical and histopathological
characteristics that depend on hormonal stimuli. The skin is not a common
location, as most cases of endometriosis involve pelvic sites, such as the
ovaries, peritoneum and bowel. However, the most common extrapelvic site affected
is the abdominal wall and this location of the disease is frequently associated
with obstetric and gynecologic surgery. Here we report a case of skin
endometriosis emerged as a painful subcutaneous nodule located near to the left
side of an obstetrical surgery procedure scar. The patient affected was a woman
in her reproductive age, with a history of right ovary endometriotic cyst
laparoscopically removed and histologically confirmed as a primary endometriosis.
Dermatologists should be aware of this condition in any woman with a painful lump
located in the proximity of a pelvic surgery-induced scar. Its non-specific
clinical appearance may confuse the clinician and may delay the diagnosis and
management.

Endometriosis (EM) is a multifactorial and debilitating chronic benign
gynecological disease, but the pathogenesis of the disease is not completely
understood. Dysregulated expression of microRNAs (miRNA/miR) is associated with
the etiology of EM due to their role in regulating endometrial stromal cell
proliferation and invasion. The present study aimed to identify the functions and
mechanisms underlying miR‑143‑3p in EM. To explore the role of miR‑143‑3p in EM, 
functional miRNAs were analyzed via bioinformatics analysis. miR‑143‑3p
expression levels in endometriotic stromal cells (ESCs) and normal endometrial
stromal cells (NESCs) were measured via reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR.
The role of miR‑143‑3p in regulating ESC proliferation and invasion was assessed 
by performing Cell Counting Kit‑8 and Transwell assays, respectively. miR‑143‑3p 
expression was significantly upregulated in ESCs compared with NESCs.
Functionally, miR‑143‑3p overexpression inhibited ESC proliferation and invasion,
whereas miR‑143‑3p knockdown promoted ESC proliferation and invasion. Moreover,
miR‑143‑3p inhibited autophagy activation in ESCs, as indicated by decreased
green puncta, which represented autophagic vacuoles, decreased microtubule
associated protein 1 light chain 3α expression and increased p62 expression in
the miR‑143‑4p mimic group compared with the control group. Moreover, compared
with the control group, miR‑143‑3p overexpression significantly decreased the
expression levels of autophagy‑related 2B (ATG2B), a newly identified target gene
of miR‑143‑3p, in ESCs. ATG2B overexpression reversed miR‑143‑3p
overexpression‑mediated inhibition of ESC proliferation and invasion.
Collectively, the results of the present study suggested that miR‑143‑3p
inhibited EM progression, thus providing a novel target for the development of
therapeutic agents against EM.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate associations between endometriosis and tubal and ovarian
cancers in a large population-based study.
METHODS: The Health Care Cost and Utilization Project - National Inpatient Sample
databases from 2005 to 2014 were used in this study. Data on patients with a
diagnosis of tubal or ovarian cancer and endometriosis (overall and subtypes
including adenomyosis and pelvic endometriosis) using International
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition, Clinical Modification codes were
extracted. Logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate associations
between tubal and ovarian cancers and endometriosis. Adjustment was made for age,
race, median income level, payment plan, hospital location and obesity.
RESULTS: Of 38,800,139 women aged >18 years who were hospitalized between 2005
and 2014, 271,444 women with adenomyosis and/or pelvic endometriosis, 4289 women 
with tubal cancer and 133,253 women with ovarian cancer were identified. The rate
of tubal cancer was three-fold higher in women with endometriosis compared with
women without endometriosis (0.03 % vs 0.01 %). The odds ratio (OR) adjusted for 
age, race, obesity, income and insurance type was 4.02 [95 % confidence interval 
(CI) 3.17-5.11; p < 0.01]. The rate of tubal cancer was higher in women with
adenomyosis (0.04 % vs 0.01 %; adjusted OR 4.88, 95 % CI 3.66-6.50; p < 0.01) and
women with pelvic endometriosis (0.02 % vs 0.01 %; adjusted OR 2.80, 95 % CI
1.84-4.27; p < 0.01) compared with women without these conditions. Similar
associations were found between ovarian cancer and pelvic endometriosis and
ovarian cancer and adenomyosis.
CONCLUSION: Both pelvic endometriosis and adenomyosis are strongly associated
with tubal and ovarian cancers.

STUDY QUESTION: What are the effects of plant-derived antioxidant compounds
urolithin A (UA) and B (UB) on the growth and pathogenetic properties of an in
vitro endometriosis model?
SUMMARY ANSWER: Both urolithins showed inhibitory effects on cell behavior
related to the development of endometriosis by differentially affecting growth,
adhesion, motility, and invasion of endometriotic cells in vitro.
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Endometriosis is one of the most common benign
gynecological diseases in women of reproductive age and is defined by the
presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity. As current
pharmacological therapies are associated with side effects interfering with
fertility, we aimed at finding alternative therapeutics using natural compounds
that can be administered for prolonged periods with a favorable side effects
profile.
STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: In vitro cultures of primary endometriotic stromal 
cells from 6 patients subjected to laparoscopy for benign pathologies with
histologically confirmed endometriosis; and immortalized endometrial stromal
(St-T1b) and endometriotic epithelial cells (12Z) were utilized to assess the
effects of UA and UB on endometriotic cell properties. Results were validated in 
three-dimensional (3D) in vitro co-culture spheroids of 12Z and primary
endometriotic stroma cells of one patient, and organoids from 3 independent
donors with endometriosis.
PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The effects on cell growth were
measured by non-radioactive colorimetric assay to measure cellular metabolic
activity as an indicator of cell viability (MTT assay) and flow cytometric cell
cycle assay on primary cultures, St-T1b, and 12Z. Apoptosis analyses, the impact 
on in vitro adhesion, migration, and invasion were evaluated in the cell lines.
Moreover, Real-Time Quantitative Reverse Transcription polymerase chain reaction 
(RT-qPCR) assays were performed on primary cultures, St- T1b and 12Z to evaluate 
a plausible mechanistic contribution by factors related to proteolysis (matrix
metalloproteinase 2, 3 and 9 -MMP2, MMP3, MMP9-, and tissue inhibitor of
metalloproteinases -TIMP-1-), cytoskeletal regulators (Ras-related C3 botulinum
toxin substrate 1 -RAC1-, Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase 2 
-ROCK2-), and cell adhesion molecules (Syndecan 1 -SDC1-, Integrin alpha
V-ITGAV-). Finally, the urolithins effects were evaluated on spheroids and
organoids by formation, viability, and drug screen assays.
MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: 40 µM UA and 20 µM UB produced a significant
decrease in cell proliferation in the primary endometriotic cell cultures
(P < 0.001 and P < 0.01, respectively) and in the St-T1b cell line (P < 0.001 and
P < 0.05, respectively). In St-T1b, UA exhibited a mean half-maximum inhibitory
concentration (IC50) of 39.88 µM, while UB exhibited a mean IC50 of 79.92 µM.
Both 40 µM UA and 20 µM UB produced an increase in cells in the S phase of the
cell cycle (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively). The same concentration of UA
also increased the percentage of apoptotic ST-t1b cells (P < 0.05), while both
urolithins decreased cell migration after 24 h (P < 0.001 both). Only the
addition of 5 µM UB decreased the number of St-T1b adherent cells. TIMP-1
expression was upregulated in response to treating the cells with 40 µM UA
(P < 0.05). Regarding the 12Z endometriotic cell line, only 40 µM UA decreased
proliferation (P < 0.01); while both 40 µM UA and 20 µM UB produced an increase
in cells in the G2/M phase (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively). In this cell
line, UA exhibited a mean IC50 of 40.46 µM, while UB exhibited a mean IC50 of
54.79 µM. UB decreased cell migration (P < 0.05), and decreased the number of
adherent cells (P < 0.05). Both 40 µM UA and 20 µM UB significantly decreased the
cellular invasion of these cells; and several genes were altered when treating
the cells with 40 µM UA and 10 µM UB. The expression of MMP2 was downregulated by
UA (P < 0.001), and expression of MMP3 (UA P < 0.001 and UB P < 0.05) and MMP9
(P < 0.05, both) were downregulated by both urolithins. Moreover, UA
significantly downregulated ROCK2 (P < 0.05), whereas UB treatment was associated
with RAC1 downregulation (P < 0.05). Finally, the matrix adhesion receptors and
signaling (co)receptors SDC1 and ITGAV were downregulated upon treatment with
either UA or UB (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively in both cases). Regarding
the effects of urolithins on 3D models, we have seen that they significantly
decrease the viability of endometriosis spheroids (80 µM UA and UB: P < 0.05
both) as well as affecting their area (40 µM UA: P < 0.05, and 80 µM UA:
P < 0.01) and integrity (40 µM UA and UB: P < 0.05, 80 µM UA and UB: P < 0.01).
On the other hand, UA and UB significantly inhibited organoid
development/outgrowth (40 and 80 µM UA: P < 0.0001 both; 40 µM UB: P <
ns-0.05-0.001, and 80 µM UB: P < 0.01-0.001-0.001), and all organoid lines show
urolithins sensitivity resulting in decreasing viability (UA exhibited a mean
IC50 of 33.93 µM, while UB exhibited a mean IC50 of 52.60 µM).

OBJECTIVES: To quantify the delays associated with the diagnosis and treatment of
diaphragmatic endometriosis (DE), and to evaluate patient-reported postoperative 
outcomes.
STUDY DESIGN: An anonymous survey was designed to collect data regarding
demographics, duration and nature of DE symptoms, type of surgery and
postoperative outcomes. Members of endometriosis patient associations in 14
countries were invited to complete the survey if they had been diagnosed with DE.
Factors associated with postoperative outcomes were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U
and Fisher's exact tests.
RESULTS: Data was available from 136 respondents (median age 34 years). 98 % of
respondents were from Europe, North America or Oceania. The most frequently
reported symptoms of DE were moderate-severe pain in the upper abdomen (68 %),
chest (64 %) and shoulder (54 %). Pain was right-sided in 54 %, left-sided in 11 
% and bilateral in 35 %. Of 122 respondents who initially consulted a primary
care physician, a gynaecology referral occurred after a median of five
consultations (range 1-100). The median time between first primary care
consultation and diagnosis of DE was two years (range 0-23). 31 % were diagnosed 
>1 year after their first gynaecology consultation (range 1-13 years), and 30 %
required two or more laparoscopies before diagnosis. 116 respondents underwent
surgical treatment. Postoperative data was available for 113 respondents, and 65 
% reported either a significant improvement or complete resolution of symptoms.
There was no significant difference in age (P = 0.19), timing of diagnosis (P =
0.59) or type of procedure (excision or ablation) (P = 0.13) between respondents 
who did and did not experience symptomatic relief after surgery. 61 % reported
long-lasting symptomatic relief after a median of 1 year, whilst 39 % reported
ongoing moderate-severe pain or have undergone further surgery for recurrent
symptoms.
CONCLUSION: The diagnosis and treatment of diaphragmatic endometriosis is often
delayed, due to lack of awareness by patients and healthcare professionals. The
diagnosis of DE requires a high index of suspicion and involvement of surgeons
trained in laparoscopic liver mobilization. Recurrent symptoms are common
following surgical treatment, and international collaborative studies are
required to determine the long-term outcomes of this condition.

RESEARCH QUESTION: Is the transcriptome of cumulus cells of infertile women with 
advanced endometriosis (EIII/IV), with and without endometrioma, altered?
DESIGN: In this prospective case-control study, next-generation RNA sequencing
was used to compare the transcript profile of cumulus cells among infertile
patients undergoing ovarian stimulation for intracytoplasmic sperm injection with
EIII/IV, with (n = 9) and without endometrioma (n = 9), and controls (n = 9). An 
in-silico enrichment analysis was conducted to establish the possibly altered
pathways in cumulus cells of patients with endometriosis.
RESULTS: Most of the differentially expressed genes (DEG) were found when cumulus
cells from women with EIII/IV with endometrioma were compared with controls (DEG,
n = 461). In women with EIII/IV without endometrioma, only 66 DEG were verified
compared with controls. The enrichment analysis showed that some DEG in cumulus
cells of endometriosis are involved in important pathways for the oocyte
competence acquisition, such as oxidative phosphorylation, metabolism,
mitochondrial function, acetylation and steroid biosynthesis. No DEG were found
when cumulus cells from women with EIII/IV with and without endometrioma were
compared.
CONCLUSION: RNA sequencing results suggest that cumulus cells of infertile women 
with EIII/IV have an altered transcriptome, regardless of endometrioma. The
present findings offer a better understanding of the genes and molecular
mechanisms that may be involved in endometriosis-related infertility, mostly in
the oocyte competence acquisition process.

This review aims to assess the current and past literature for efficacious
non-invasive diagnostic markers for earlier detection of endometriosis. We
briefly discussed the associations of endometriosis with other autoimmune
diseases (AID), as well as the broad changes that occur within the immune system.
Specifically, we focused on the usage of various autoantibodies as a potential
non-invasive diagnostic tool. Autoantibodies have been noted in the literature
since the 1980s and their usage could possibly reduce the delay of an
endometriosis diagnosis. Our search concluded that various anti endometrial
antibodies may offer useful diagnostic tools. Anti-SLP2, anti-TMOD3, anti-TPM3,
and anti-PDIK1L are particularly useful for early diagnosis in minimal to mild
endometriosis. Anti-alpha enolase could also be used but yields results similar
to CA125. Other non anti endometrial antibodies like anti-IMP1, anti-CA, aCL,
anti-STX5 may be used as additional non-invasive diagnostic tools. Anti-TPO may
be beneficial in patients in endometriosis patients with concurrent polycystic
ovaries syndrome (PCOS). As the pathogenesis of endometriosis continues to reveal
itself, more autoantibodies are being discovered and they may offer useful
non-invasive tools for the early diagnosis of endometriosis.

Endometriosis is a disorder in which endometrial cells normally limited to the
lining of the uterus proliferate outside the uterine cavity and can cause pelvic 
pain and infertility. ARID1A levels are significantly reduced in the eutopic
endometrium from women with endometriosis. Uterine specific Arid1a knock-out mice
were infertile due to loss of epithelial progesterone receptor (PGR) signaling.
However, the functional association of ARID1A and PGR in endometriosis has not
been studied. We examined the expression patterns and co-localization of ARID1A
and PGR in eutopic endometrium from women with and without endometriosis using
immunostaining and Western blot analysis. ARID1A and PGR proteins co-localized in
the epithelium during the proliferative and the early secretory phases. Our
immunoprecipitation analysis and proximity ligation assay (PLA) revealed physical
interaction between ARID1A and PGR-A but not PGR-B in the mouse and human
endometrium. ARID1A levels positively correlated with PGR levels in the eutopic
endometrium of women with endometriosis. Our results bring new perspectives on
the molecular mechanisms involved in endometrial receptivity and progesterone
resistance in endometriosis. The interrelationship between ARID1A and PGR may
contribute to explaining the non-receptive endometrium in endometriosis-related
infertility.

KRAS is the most frequently mutated in ovarian endometriosis. However, it is
unclear whether the KRAS mutant allele's mRNA is expressed and plays a biological
role in ovarian endometriosis. Here, we performed mutation-specific RNA in situ
hybridization to evaluate mutant allele expression of KRAS p.G12V, the most
frequently detected mutation in ovarian endometriosis in our previous study, in
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue (FFPE) samples of ovarian endometriosis, 
cancer cell lines, and ovarian cancers. First, we verified that mutant or
wild-type allele of KRAS were expressed in all 5 cancer cell lines and 9 ovarian 
cancer cases corresponding to the mutation status. Next, we applied this assay to
26 ovarian endometriosis cases, and observed mutant allele expression of KRAS
p.G12V in 10 cases. Mutant or wild-type allele of KRAS were expressed in line
with mutation status in 12 available endometriosis cases for which KRAS gene
sequence was determined. Comparison of clinical features between ovarian
endometriosis with KRAS p.G12V mutant allele expression and with KRAS wild-type
showed that KRAS p.G12V mutant allele expression was significantly associated
with inflammation in ovarian endometriosis. Finally, we assessed the spatial
distribution of KRAS mutant allele expression in 5 endometriosis cases by
performing multiregional sampling. Intratumor heterogeneity of KRAS mutant allele
expression was observed in two endometriosis cases, whereas the spatial
distribution of KRAS p.G12V mutation signals were diffuse and homogenous in
ovarian cancer. In conclusion, evaluation of oncogene mutant expression will be
useful for clarifying the biological significance of oncogene mutations in benign
tumors.

Diaphragmatic endometriosis is extremely rare. Although endometriosis is
considered generally benign, malignant transformation of endometriosis was
reported in 1925. Multiple studies have since described clear cell carcinoma
(CCC) or endometrioid carcinoma arising from ovarian endometriosis. Previously,
only two reports of primary diaphragmatic CCC were reported, in which coexistent 
endometriosis with CCC was not histologically proven. We report a case of a
55-year-old postmenopausal woman who was admitted to Kindai university hospital
for the examination of a cystic mass with papillary components in the right
diaphragm. On her past medical history, abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy was performed for high-grade cervical intraepithelial
neoplasia, uterine myoma, and bilateral ovarian endometriosis 5 years ago.
Unenhanced CT performed 5 years ago, showed a nodular lesion with low density in 
the right diaphragm, consistent with diaphragmatic endometriosis. Magnetic
resonance imaging during this admission, showed a cystic mass with papillary
components in the right diaphragm and a T2*-weighted gradient echo imaging showed
partial low signal intensity in the papillary components and cyst wall, which was
suspected to represent hemosiderin deposition. Based on these serial images,
malignant transformation of diaphragmatic endometriosis was suspected. Under,
open abdominal combined resection of the mass and part of the diaphragm was
performed. Endometriosis implants were detected on the pelvic peritoneum.
Histopathological examination revealed clear cell carcinoma associated with
endometriosis and hemosiderin deposition in the cyst wall. T2*-weighted gradient 
echo imaging was useful in the detection of hemosiderin deposition caused by the 
coexistent endometriosis. When a cystic mass with papillary components and cyst
wall with hemosiderin deposits are encountered on MR images, malignant
transformation of endometriosis is suspected and a detailed medical history
should be determined and the possibility of concurrent endometriosis or
adenomyosis should be investigated, as should the potential existence of
diaphragmatic endometriosis in previous images.

AIM: To explore the regulatory role and molecular mechanism of lncRNA-LINC01279
in endometriosis (EMs).
METHODS: Between September 2018 and July 2019, 20 EMs patients and 20 healthy
subjects were recruited to detect the expression of lncRNA-LINC01279 in EMs and
in normal endometrium via qRT-PCR. Autograft was used to establish EMs models on 
Spraque-Dawley (SD) rats, which was followed by taking volume measurements of EMs
endometrium and observing pathological changes in the morphology of EMs via
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. The qRT-PCR technique was further carried
out to determine mRNA expression of lncRNA-LINC01279 and HOXA10 in the serum of
EMs rats and LINC01279 shRNA-transfected rats, while the protein expression of
HOXA10 was determined using a Western blot.
RESULTS: EMs patients presented with upregulation of lncRNA-LINC01279 and
downregulation of HOXA10 (p < 0.01 or 0.001). Online predictions further revealed
that lncRNA-LINC01279 regulated the expression of HOXA10 via miRNA-135b. In EMs
models, it was observed that there were a significantly enlarged endometrium and 
poor pathological morphology, significant upregulation of lncRNA-LINC01279, and
downregulation of miR-135b and HOXA10 in serum (p < 0.05, 0.01 or 0.001). In the 
lncRNA-LINC01279 shRNA group, EMs rats, following treatment, had a sharp decrease
in the volume of EMs endometrium, and an improvement in pathological morphology, 
while lncRNA-LINC01279 was downregulated, with upregulation of miR-135b and
HOXA10 (p < 0.05, 0.01 or 0.001).
CONCLUSION: LncRNA-LINC01279, by the mechanism of targeting miR-135b, has the
potential to downregulate the expression of HOXA10, and therefore, can promote
the development and progression of EMs.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to analyze the factors
affecting recurrence-free (RFS) and overall survival (OS) rates of women
diagnosed with low-grade serous ovarian cancer (LGSOC).
METHODS: Databases from 13 participating centers in Turkey were searched
retrospectively for women who had been treated for stage I-IV LGSOC between 1997 
and 2018.
RESULTS: Overall 191 eligible women were included. The median age at diagnosis
was 49 years (range, 21-84 years). One hundred seventy-five (92%) patients
underwent primary cytoreductive surgery. Complete and optimal cytoreduction was
achieved in 148 (77.5%) and 33 (17.3%) patients, respectively. The median
follow-up period was 44 months (range, 2-208 months). Multivariate analysis
showed the presence of endometriosis (p = .012), lymphovascular space invasion
(LVSI) (p = .022), any residual disease (p = .023), and the International
Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage II-IV disease (p = .045)
were negatively correlated with RFS while the only presence of residual disease
(p = .002) and FIGO stage II-IV disease (p = .003) significantly decreased OS.
CONCLUSIONS: The maximal surgical effort is warranted for complete cytoreduction 
as achieving no residual disease is the single most important variable affecting 
the survival of patients with LGSOC. The prognostic role of LVSI and
endometriosis should be evaluated by further studies as both of these parameters 
significantly affected RFS.

Adenomyosis is a gynecological condition, which is characterized by stromal and
glandular endometrial tissue infiltration inti the myometrium, resulting in an
increase of uterine volume. The etiology of adenomyosis is presently unknown, but
some theories assist us in understanding its pathogenesis and natural history.
Clinical manifestations are increased menstrual flow and dysmenorrhea, abnormal
uterine bleeding, chronic pelvic pain, and dyspareunia. The signs and symptoms
suggestive of adenomyosis are complemented by diagnostic methods such as
transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS), ideally with intestinal preparation, magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) and surgery; although currently, there are no precise
criteria for the classification of findings on imaging studies. The clinical and 
surgical therapeutic approach must be individualized, taking into account the
patient's characteristics, for instance, age, parity, depth and number of
adenomyotic foci, uterine volume and, mainly, clinical manifestations. A causal
relation between adenomyosis and infertility has been repeatedly suggested,
mostly due to the anatomo-physiopathological conditions originated by the
adenomyosis on the female genital tract; however, definitive conclusions are
still lacking. This pathology is found in approximately 25% of infertile women,
especially those who have had recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL), recurrent
implantation failure, older women seeking In Vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment,
and those with concomitant endometriosis. To determine whether adenomyosis per se
affects fertility, several researchers have focused on women who are affected by 
the condition and underwent IVF/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI); for this
model provides more accurate data about the influence of adenomyosis on embryo
implantation. Therefore, our objective was to analyze, through a systematic
literature review, the effect of uterine adenomyosis on the probability of
pregnancy by IVF / ICSI, as well as trying to point out the main difficulties and
gaps to establish a standard protocol for the management of these patients, since
most of the patients with adenomyosis have other associated gynecological
pathologies, mostly endometriosis; in addition to the heterogeneity of the
studies still remaining as an obstacle to precise conclusions.

OBJECTIVE: Combined oral contraceptives (COC) and progestogens are widely used
for the treatment of endometriosis. The objective of the study is to compare the 
efficacy of dienogest 2 mg vs continuous oral levonorgestrel/EE (levonorgestrel
0.1 mg/ethinyl estradiol 0.02 mg) on ovarian endometriomas, deep infiltrating
endometriosis (DIE), chronic pelvic pain (CPP), dyspareunia, analgesic use,
quality of life (QoL), compliance and side effects.
METHODS: Prospective cohort study. Two cohorts of patients with endometriosis, 50
taking dienogest (group A) and 50 taking continuous levonorgestrel/EE (group B), 
were evaluated at the beginning of therapy (t0), after 3 (t3) and 6 months (t6). 
Size of endometriomas, DIE, QoL, pain symptoms, and side effects were assessed.
RESULTS: Dienogest was significantly effective on CPP (p = .002), dyspareunia
(p = .021) ovarian endometriomas (p = .015) and DIE lesions reduction (p = .014).
Levonorgestrel/EE was significantly effective on dyspareunia (p = .023).
Analgesics consumption significantly decreased in both groups (p < .001). Both
treatments significantly improved the QoL. Over 6 months a significant
improvement was found, more frequently in patients taking dienogest. The only
side effect that both groups complained about was vaginal bleeding, present in
the first 3 months of treatment (p < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: Both treatments are effective and safe for patients with
endometriosis. Patients compliance and side effects are similar in both groups,
however, there was a significantly higher reduction in endometriotic lesions,
pain symptoms, and improvement of the QoL in women taking dienogest than in women
taking continuous COC.

OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate a unique presentation and surgical treatment of a
posterior uteroperitoneal fistula with excision of the fistula tract and repair
in multiple layers.
DESIGN: Illustrative video presentation. A case report is used to describe
potential causes of an uteroperitoneal fistula found in a patient during
evaluation of secondary infertility and to highlight surgical technique and
management using the principles of fistula repair through a minimally invasive
approach. The Institutional Review Board reviewed this video article and it was
deemed "not human subject research."
SETTING: Tertiary medical center.
PATIENT(S): A 33-year-old G1P1001 woman with a history of a cesarean section
presented with secondary infertility, pelvic pain, and dysmenorrhea and was found
to have a posterior uteroperitoneal fistula at the time of hysterosalpingography.
INTERVENTION(S): The patient underwent an uncomplicated robot-assisted
laparoscopic excision of a posterior uteroperitoneal fistula with the use of
careful dissection of the fistula tract, continuous reassessment, and
tension-free closure in layers.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Preoperative diagnosis and surgical management
displaying intraoperative techniques for robot-assisted excision of fistula tract
and repair of defect.
RESULT(S): The patient underwent robot-assisted operative laparoscopy that
revealed a 4-cm mass on the right posterior aspect of the uterus independent from
her adnexa. Concomitant hysteroscopy revealed normal endometrium without an
evident fistula. During chromopertubation, extravasation was seen into the
peritoneal cavity from this mass. The mass and fistula tract were excised without
a connection found from her cesarean scar, and reconstruction was performed in
multiple layers. Endometriotic lesions were noted intraperitoneally in locations 
distant from the mass. The patient had significant improvement in her symptoms
after surgery.
CONCLUSION(S): We present a unique case of a suspected spontaneous posterior
uteroperitoneal fistula in the presence of endometriosis without evidence of a
connection to her prior hysterotomy scar. Possible etiologies include an
undiagnosed, unrepaired hysterotomy extension or a result of chronic inflammation
from deep infiltrating endometriosis. Adverse effects on fertility from
uteroperitoneal fistulas may be due to disruption of sperm function or
endometrial quality secondary to presence of old blood products sequestered in
the fistula or due to resultant inflammation from the same. As in this video
case, successful treatment of symptoms resulting from an uteroperitoneal fistula 
requires removal of the fistula tract. The constellation of pelvic pain,
dysmenorrhea, postmenstrual bleeding, and infertility should raise suspicion for 
an uteroperitoneal fistula.

Hematosalpinx is the accumulation of blood in fallopian tubes. Its most common
cause is ectopic pregnancy, but the other causes include pelvic inflammatory
disease (PID), endometriosis and pelvic trauma. We report a rare case of
hematosalpinx in a 45-year-old female with no obvious cause. She presented with
acute sharp right iliac fossa pain not relieving with analgesics. She did not
have a history of fever, PID, endometriosis, or trauma. Her menstrual cycle was
also normal and β-hcG was negative. Ultrasound showed the right ovarian cyst and 
was suggesting of hemorrhagic. She was operated and a large hematosalpinx was
observed. This rare case suggests the possibility of Hematosalpinx in the mid-40s
besides ruling out the possibility of some of the causes hypothesized in the
relevant literature. The case highlights the need to better understand the
pathophysiology of hematosalpinx.

AIMS: Memory impairment is determined to be the most well-known symptom of
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although cell therapy seems is an efficient therapeutic
strategy to attenuate the AD-related memory impairment, transplanted cells have a
short lifespan and do not survive long term in the recipient animals. Herein, we 
investigated whether the combination therapy of Selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs)
and stem cells attenuates the neurotoxicity in an AD animal model.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AMSCs) were
transplanted in the AD model. In addition to cell injections, the animals also
received oral administration of SeNPs (0.4 mg/kg) for one month. Recognition
memory, cell survival, and BDNF concentration were assessed using the novel
object recognition task, immunofluorescence, and ELISA methods.
KEY FINDINGS: Our results showed that the combined therapy was more effective in 
increasing the discrimination index than the administering SeNPs or AMSCs alone. 
Moreover, SeNPs and stem cells together had the greatest effects in reducing the 
deposition of Aβ and increasing the concentration of BDNF. Ultimately, the
survival and proliferation of transplanted cells were more in the group that
received stem cells besides SeNPs.
SIGNIFICANCE: Taken together, it seems that the transplantation of MSCs combined 
with SeNPs could achieve better results in the neuroprotection in the AD model
than a conventional treatment of SeNPs or stem cells alone.

The current study was conducted to investigate the therapeutic effects of
atorvastatin (ATV) and resveratrol (RVT) in sole and simultaneous forms of
administration against the symbiosis between glucose transporters 1 and 3 (GLUT-1
and GLUT-3), monocarboxylate transporters 1 a and 4 (MCT-1 and MCT-4) and
neovascularization in ectopic endometrial tissue (EET). For this purpose, the
experimental endometriosis was induced in 24 virgin female Wistar rats, and then 
the rats were divided into non-treated endometriosis-induced (ENDO-sole),
AVT-treated (5 mg kg-1), RVT-treated (40 mg kg-1) and AVT +RVT-treated groups
(n = 6 rats in each group). Following 28 days from the experimental endometriosis
induction, the EETs were collected and the EETs size, neovascularization ratio,
and expression levels of GLUT-1, GLUT-3, MCT-1, and MCT-4 were analyzed by
qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC). The AVT and RVT sole and
simultaneous-treated animals exhibited decreased EET sizes and
neovascularization. Moreover, the mRNA levels of GLUT-1, GLUT-3, MCT-1, and
MCT-4, as well as GLUT-1+, GLUT-3+, and MCT-4+ cells distribution per mm2 of
tissue were decreased in AVT and RVT sole and simultaneous-treated groups. Our
findings showed that the AVT and RVT, especially in the simultaneous form of
administration, could decrease the neovascularization development in the EETs by 
suppressing the GLUTs (1 and 3) and MCTs (1 and 4) expressions. Therefore, it can
be concluded that the simultaneous administration of AVT and RVT can inhibit the 
EET's establishment and development through suppressing glycolysis and
neovascularization.

STUDY QUESTION: How accurately do women report a diagnosis of endometriosis on
self-administered questionnaires?
SUMMARY ANSWER: Based on the analysis of four international cohorts, women
self-report endometriosis fairly accurately with a > 70% confirmation for
clinical and surgical records.
WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: The study of complex diseases requires large, diverse
population-based samples, and endometriosis is no exception. Due to the
difficulty of obtaining medical records for a condition that may have been
diagnosed years earlier and for which there is no standardized documentation,
reliance on self-report is necessary. Only a few studies have assessed the
validity of self-reported endometriosis compared with medical records, with the
observed confirmation ranging from 32% to 89%.
STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: We compared questionnaire-reported endometriosis
with medical record notation among participants from the Black Women's Health
Study (BWHS; 1995-2013), Etude Epidémiologique auprès de femmes de la Mutuelle
Générale de l'Education Nationale (E3N; 1990-2006), Growing Up Today Study (GUTS;
2005-2016), and Nurses' Health Study II (NHSII; 1989-1993 first wave, 1995-2007
second wave).
PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Participants who had reported
endometriosis on self-administered questionnaires gave permission to procure and 
review their clinical, surgical, and pathology medical records, yielding records 
for 827 women: 225 (BWHS), 168 (E3N), 85 (GUTS), 132 (NHSII first wave), and 217 
(NHSII second wave). We abstracted diagnosis confirmation as well as American
Fertility Society (AFS) or revised American Society of Reproductive Medicine
(rASRM) stage and visualized macro-presentation (e.g. superficial peritoneal,
deep endometriosis, endometrioma). For each cohort, we calculated clinical
reference to endometriosis, and surgical- and pathologic-confirmation
proportions.
MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Confirmation was high-84% overall when
combining clinical, surgical, and pathology records (ranging from 72% for BWHS to
95% for GUTS), suggesting that women accurately report if they are told by a
physician that they have endometriosis. Among women with self-reported
laparoscopic confirmation of their endometriosis diagnosis, confirmation of
medical records was extremely high (97% overall, ranging from 95% for NHSII
second wave to 100% for NHSII first wave). Importantly, only 42% of medical
records included pathology reports, among which histologic confirmation ranged
from 76% (GUTS) to 100% (NHSII first wave). Documentation of visualized
endometriosis presentation was often absent, and details recorded were
inconsistent. AFS or rASRM stage was documented in 44% of NHSII first wave, 13%
of NHSII second wave, and 24% of GUTS surgical records. The presence/absence of
deep endometriosis was rarely noted in the medical records.
LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Medical record abstraction was conducted
separately by cohort-specific investigators, potentially introducing
misclassification due to variation in abstraction protocols and interpretation.
Additionally, information on the presence/absence of AFS/rASRM stage, deep
endometriosis, and histologic findings were not available for all four cohort
studies.
WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Variation in access to care and differences
in disease phenotypes and risk factor distributions among patients with
endometriosis necessitates the use of large, diverse population samples to
subdivide patients for risk factor, treatment response and discovery of long-term
outcomes. Women self-report endometriosis with reasonable accuracy (>70%) and
with exceptional accuracy when women are restricted to those who report that
their endometriosis had been confirmed by laparoscopic surgery (>94%). Thus,
relying on self-reported endometriosis in order to use larger sample sizes of
patients with endometriosis appears to be valid, particularly when self-report of
laparoscopic confirmation is used as the case definition. However, the paucity of
data on histologic findings, AFS/rASRM stage, and endometriosis phenotypic
characteristics suggests that a universal requirement for harmonized clinical and
surgical data documentation is needed if we hope to obtain the relevant details
for subgrouping patients with endometriosis.

AIM: Endometriosis is an estrogen-dependent chronic inflammatory condition which 
causes pain, infertility, and predisposition for ovarian cancer. Endometriosis
generates a unique microenvironment for survivability of endometriotic lesions
which includes cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and apoptosis. For
these cellular activities, cascading activations of intracellular kinases are
needed. Many kinase signaling pathways, IKKβ/NK-κB pathway, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, and
the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways (ERK1/2, p38, and JNK), are 
activated in endometriosis. In this review, we focus on the role of MAPK pathways
in endometriosis.
METHODS: To identify the role of MAP Kinase signaling pathway in endometriosis we
searched the Pubmed database using the search terms in various combinations
"endometriosis," "endometrium," "ovary," "MAPK pathway," "ERK pathway," "p38
pathway," "JNK pathway," "estrogen," and "progesterone."
RESULTS: According to the current literature, MAPK signaling pathway has various 
roles in generating microenvironment and survival of endometriosis. Abnormal MAPK
activation in migration, implantation, growth, invasion into the pelvic
structures, proliferation, and apoptosis leads to the form of endometriosis and
to worsen the condition in patients with endometriosis.
CONCLUSION: To further investigations on the effective and long-term
endometriosis treatment, MAPK signaling pathways may be targeted. Molecular
mechanism of MAPK signaling pathway in endometriosis should be more deeply
understood and clinical trials should be more commonly performed for possible new
endometriosis treatments to improve fertility and rescue endometriosis
irreversibly.

OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate an outpatient vaginoscopic technique for treating
multiple vaginal polyps.
DESIGN: Demonstration of surgical technique using slides, pictures, and video.
SETTING: Private hospital.
PATIENT(S): Thirty-two-year-old nulligravid woman presenting to the gynecology
clinic with one episode of intermenstrual bleeding, regular menstrual cycles with
normal flow, and no history of dysmenorrhoea or dyspareunia. The genital local
examination was normal, and speculum examination showed multiple vaginal lesions 
like polyps in the proximal posterior two-thirds and right lateral vaginal walls.
Her transvaginal ultrasound read a normal uterus with a right ovarian simple
cyst.
INTERVENTION(S): The surgeon performed an outpatient operative vaginoscopy using 
a 5-mm continuous flow office hysteroscope with a 2.9-mm rod lens optical system 
and a 5F working channel. Distension of the vagina was achieved with a normal
saline solution, and an intrauterine pressure of 50 to 60 mm Hg was maintained by
an irrigation and aspiration electronic pump. An inspection of the vaginal walls,
fornices, and the external cervical os (Fig. 1) revealed 10 vaginal lesions like 
polyps in the proximal two-thirds of the posterior and right lateral vaginal
wall. The vaginal lesions (Fig. 2) varied in size from 0.5 cm to 4 cm. An
excisional biopsy was performed and the sample sent for histopathologic
evaluation. The vaginal lesions <2 cm in length were excised by cutting the base 
with scissors or using a bipolar vaporization electrode, which was connected to
an electrocautery unit by a bipolar high-frequency cord. Vaginal lesions >2 cm
were excised with the TruClear 5C Hysteroscopic Tissue Removal System (HTRS) with
a zero-degree scope using the 2.9-mm incisor with a 5-mm cutting window at one
end attached to a reusable handpiece with two connectors-one to the motor unit
and second to the suction bottle with a collection bag. The overall diameter of
TruClear 5C is 5.7 mm, and the optic size is 0.8 mm. The same irrigation pump is 
compatible with HTRS, and the pressure was increased to 150 mm Hg to maintain
vaginal distension. Three factors influenced our decision to use the HTRS
intraoperatively: the number and size of the vaginal lesions and the surgical
time in the outpatient setting. A mechanical system that works on the principle
of excising and aspirating tissue, the HTRS incisor has a rotatory action with
the excising window placed against the most distal part of the vaginal lesions.
The cutting action is controlled via a foot pedal attached to a motor control
with 800 rotations per minute. The handpiece remains stationary while the polyp
is excised and aspirated through the window into the collection bag. Minimal
bleeding occurred and stopped spontaneously. The institutional ethics committee
exempted this case report from review, and we obtained informed written consent
from the patient.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): All vaginal lesions excised in an outpatient setting via
vaginoscopy technique without anesthesia.
RESULT(S): The operative time with the Bettocchi hysteroscope was 14 minutes, and
HTRS was 6 minutes. The patient did not complain of pain but did describe minimal
discomfort, rated on the visual analog scale as 2 (where ≥5 is severe pain). She 
was discharged 1 hour later. The histopathology was reported as vaginal
endometriosis (ectopic presentation of endometriosis is rare, accounting for
0.02% of cases). After surgery, she was started on cyclical oral contraceptive
pills (OCP) in the combination of 30 mg of ethinyl estradiol + 2 mg of dienogest 
because she desired to delay pregnancy by 1 year. She remained asymptomatic for 6
months. These contraceptive hormones are available in the form of oral pills,
vaginal rings, and transdermal patches, and a physician can provide OCP
continuously or cyclically. Continuous OCP is more efficacious for control of
dysmenorrhoea, but cyclical OCP is preferred because it is affordable, tolerable,
effective, produces no unpredictable bleeding, and slows the progression of the
disease. (A cohort study found the contraceptive vaginal ring to be more
effective for symptom-control in rectovaginal endometriosis with higher patient
satisfaction than the transdermal patch; vaginal rings or transdermal patches are
not available in some countries.) CONCLUSION(S): Vaginoscopy allows a more
in-depth visualization of the vagina with complete inspection and removal of all 
polyps. Vaginoscopy is feasible in the outpatient setting and allows a
comfortable, ergonomic position for the surgeon. Vaginoscopy or no-touch
technique avoids the use of a speculum or tenaculum and results in minimal pain
during the outpatient procedure.

Currently, ultrasound (US) is a valuable imaging tool for the initial assessment 
and evaluation of the female genital organs, uterus, and adnexa. However, it is
easy to overlook the uterine cervix while conducting a pelvic US. Uterine
cervical lesions may range from benign to malignant in nature. Therefore,
meticulous examination with US may play a key role in assessing uterine cervical 
lesions. Although there is substantial overlap in the US findings across various 
uterine cervical lesions, some US features, in tandem with clinical
characteristics, may suggest a specific diagnosis. Familiarity with the clinical 
settings and US characteristics of different uterine cervical lesions can support
prompt and accurate diagnosis of suspicious lesions. This review article aims to 
describe the features of US and possible values for distinction of these lesions 
in the uterine cervix.

OBJECTIVES: Increased risk of preterm birth (PTB) in women with endometriosis is 
considered to be associated with chronic inflammatory conditions. Accordingly, we
hypothesized that a prepregnancy antiinflammatory diet is a potential form of
preconception care for preventing PTB in women with endometriosis and conducted
this study to investigate the correlation of a prepregnancy antiinflammatory diet
with obstetric outcomes in this patient population.
METHODS: We used singleton pregnancy data from the Japan Environment and
Children's Study involving live births from 2011 to 2014. Individual meal
patterns before pregnancy, derived through food frequency questionnaires, were
used to calculate the Dietary Inflammatory Index. Participants were categorized
according to Dietary Inflammatory Index quintiles (Q1 and Q5 were the most
proinflammatory and antiinflammatory groups, respectively), and a multiple
logistic regression model was used to estimate the effect of the antiinflammatory
diet on PTB before 37 or 34 wk and on low birth weight (LBW) <2500 or 1500 g.
RESULTS: In women who did not undergo assisted reproduction, significantly
reduced risk was found in the Q5 group for both PTB at <34 wk significantly
decreased (adjusted odds ratio, 0.25; 95% confidence interval, 0.07-0.83) and low
birth weight <1500 g (adjusted odds ratio, 0.07; 95% confidence interval,
0.01-0.60).
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests a distinct effect of an antiinflammatory diet on
more severe obstetric outcomes, specifically PTB before 34 wk and low birth
weight <1500 g, for women with endometriosis. Preconception lifestyle can improve
perinatal mortality and morbidity among these women.

CONTEXT: Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) have emerged as modulators of the
disease microenvironment, thereby supporting disease progression. However, the
potential role of EVs and their content to the pathophysiology of endometriosis
remain unclear.
OBJECTIVE: This work aimed to investigate whether the EVs from eutopic (Eu) and
ectopic (Ec) endometrial stromal cells (ESCs) differ with respect to protein
composition and role in endometriosis.
METHODS: Human Eu and Ec endometrium-derived ESCs were isolated from samples of
the same patients (n = 3). sEVs were isolated from ESCs via ultracentrifugation; 
these sEVs were characterized by Western blotting, transmission electron
microscopy, and nanoparticle tracking analysis and analyzed using mass
spectrometry. The potential role of EcESCs-derived sEVs (EcESCs-sEVs) in
endometriosis was explored by assaying their effects on cell
viability/proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis.
RESULTS: In total, 105 ESCs-sEV-associated proteins were identified from
EcESCs-sEVs and EuESCs-sEVs by mass spectrometry analysis. The protein content
differed between EcESCs-sEVs and EuESCs-sEVs, with annexin A2 (ANXA2) being the
most prominent difference-present in EcESCs-sEVs but not EuESCs-sEVs. We also
found that sEVs-ANXA2 regulates the motility, proliferation, and angiogenesis of 
ESCs via the extracellularly regulated kinase (ERK)/STAT3 pathway. Notably,
treatment of ESCs with sEVs-ANXA2 resulted in increased proliferation and
motility, suggesting that sEVs-ANXA2 may be involved in regulating endometriosis.
Our data suggest that EcESCs-sEVs-ANXA2 regulates the motility and the angiogenic
potential of ESCs, implying a role for sEVs-ANXA2 in the pathogenesis of
endometriosis.
CONCLUSION: The study of sEVs-ANXA2 from Ec endometriotic cells uncovers a new
mechanism of endometriosis progression and will inform the development of novel
therapeutic strategies.

STUDY OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to provide a contemporary
description of hysterectomy practice and temporal trends in Canada.
DESIGN: A national whole-population retrospective analysis of data from the
Canadian Institute for Health Information.
SETTING: Canada.
PATIENTS: All women who underwent hysterectomy for benign indication from April
1, 2007, to March 31, 2017, in Canada.
INTERVENTIONS: Hysterectomy.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 369 520 hysterectomies were performed
in Canada during the 10-year period, during which the hysterectomy rate decreased
from 313 to 243 per 100 000 women. The proportion of abdominal hysterectomies
decreased (59.5% to 36.9%), laparoscopic hysterectomies increased (10.8% to
38.6%), and vaginal hysterectomies decreased (29.7% to 24.5%), whereas the
national technicity index increased from 40.5% to 63.1% (p <.001, all trends).
The median length of stay decreased from 3 (interquartile range 2-4) days to 2
(interquartile range 1-3), and the proportion of patients discharged within 24
hours increased from 2.1% to 7.2%. In year 2016-17, women aged 40 to 49 years had
significantly increased risk of abdominal hysterectomy compared with women
undergoing hysterectomy in other age categories (p <.001). Comparing women with
menstrual bleeding disorders, women undergoing hysterectomy for endometriosis
(adjusted relative risk [aRR] 1.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28-1.44) and 
myomas (aRR 2.01; 95% CI, 1.94-2.08) were at increased risk of abdominal
hysterectomy, whereas women undergoing hysterectomy for pelvic organ prolapse and
pelvic pain (aRR 1.47; 95% CI, 1.41-1.53) were at decreased risk. Using Ontario
as the comparator, Nova Scotia (aRR 1.35; 95% CI, 1.27-1.43), New Brunswick (aRR 
1.25; 95% CI, 1.18-1.32]), Manitoba (aRR 1.35; 95% CI, 1.28-1.43), and
Newfoundland and Labrador (aRR 1.18; 95% CI, 1.10-1.27) had significantly higher 
risks of abdominal hysterectomy. In contrast, Saskatchewan (aRR 0.75; 95% CI,
0.74-0.77) and British Columbia (aRR 0.86; 95% CI, 0.85-0.88) had significantly
lower risks, whereas Prince Edward Island, Quebec, and Alberta were not
significantly different.
CONCLUSION: The proportion of minimally invasive hysterectomies for benign
indication has increased significantly in Canada. The declining use of vaginal
approaches and the variation among provinces are of concern and necessitate
further study.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the changing pattern of bone mineral
density (BMD) levels after 3 years of dienogest use post endometrioma surgery and
investigate the possible predictive factors for BMD reduction. This retrospective
study included 44 reproductive-aged women who took dienogest (2 mg/day) and
followed up BMD for 3 years after laparoscopic endometrioma surgery from July
2013 to December 2018. In addition, to investigate the predictive factors in the 
group with decreased BMD, analysis was added for patients with decreased BMD
after taking dienogest for 1 year post laparoscopic endometrioma surgery. After
3 years of treatment with dienogest, BMD of both the lumbar spine (- 4.4%) and
femur neck (- 3.6%) decreased significantly compared to the baseline levels. Bone
loss predominantly occurred during the first year of treatment in the lumbar
spine (- 2.4%) and gradually decreased with time during the treatment period. The
predictive factors for BMD reduction after dienogest use were evaluated based on 
a 1-year change in BMD levels of 160 women, but no associated factors were found.
This study demonstrated that dienogest use for 3 years was associated with a
significant and gradual decrease in BMD and no predictive factors for BMD
reduction during the first year of treatment with dienogest were found. These
results may be useful in counseling patients regarding long-term effects of
dienogest use on reducing BMD levels so that appropriate preventive measures can 
be taken.

Pyroptosis, an inflammatory form of programmed cell death, takes an essential
part in a wide variety of physiological activities, for instance, implantation,
placentation and the body's defense against infection. However, once excessively 
activated, pyroptosis mediated by the activation of inflammasomes can be highly
pathological. It can cause inflammatory and autoimmune diseases including a
variety of obstetrical and gynecological diseases, such as endometriosis,
gestational diabetes mellitus, insulin resistance in polycystic ovary syndrome,
and multiple obstetric complications including preeclampsia. Although the role of
pyroptosis in the pathogenesis of the above mentioned diseases has not been fully
elucidated, we try to tap its therapeutic potential by targeting pyroptosis
signaling and inflammasome formation. Pyroptosis and inflammasomes are confirmed 
to be involved in endometriosis and gynecological malignant tumors, therefore,
medical approachs inducing pyroptosis of the ectopic endometrium and tumor cells 
can be feasible treatments for endometriosis and gynecological cancers. On the
maternal-fetal interface, although a certain level of the innate immune response 
activation is required for a successful implantation and placentation, maternal
and fetal injury may occur once the inflammasomes are over-activated. Besides,
since gestational diabetes mellitus and insulin resistance in polycystic ovary
syndrome share common pathogenesis with metabolic diseases, this domain research 
sheds light on future study of some obstetrical and gynecological diseases.

OBJECTIVES: Deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) is associated with chronic
pelvic pain, dyspareunia and pelvic floor muscle hypertonia. The primary aim of
this study was to evaluate the effect of pelvic floor physiotherapy (PFP) on the 
area of levator ani hiatus during Valsalva maneuver, assessed using transperineal
ultrasound, in women with DIE suffering from superficial dyspareunia.
METHODS: This was a randomized controlled trial of 34 nulliparous women diagnosed
with DIE and associated superficial dyspareunia. After an initial clinical
examination, all patients underwent three-dimensional/four-dimensional (3D/4D)
transperineal ultrasound to measure the levator hiatal area (LHA) at rest, on
maximum pelvic floor muscle contraction and on maximum Valsalva maneuver, and
were asked to rate their pain symptoms using a numerical rating scale (NRS).
Eligible women were assigned randomly (1:1 ratio) to no intervention (control
group, 17 women) or treatment with five individual sessions of PFP (study group, 
17 women). Four months after the first examination, all women underwent a second 
evaluation of pain symptoms and LHA on transperineal ultrasound. The primary
outcome measure was the percentage change in LHA on maximum Valsalva maneuver
between the baseline and follow-up examinations. The percentage changes in pain
symptoms between the two examinations, including superficial and deep
dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea, chronic pelvic pain, dysuria and dyschezia, were also 
evaluated.
RESULTS: Thirty women, comprising 17 in the study group and 13 in the control
group, completed the study and were included in the analysis. The percentage
change in LHA on maximum Valsalva maneuver between the two examinations was
higher in the study group than in the control group (20.0 ± 24.8% vs -0.5 ± 3.3%;
P = 0.02), indicating better pelvic floor muscle relaxation. After PFP treatment,
the NRS score for superficial dyspareunia remained almost unchanged in the
control group (median change in NRS (Δ-NRS), 0 (interquartile range (IQR), 0-0)) 
while a marked reduction was observed in the study group (median Δ-NRS, -3 (IQR, 
-4 to -2); P < 0.01). Moreover, there was a significant difference between the
PFP and control groups with regards to the change in chronic pelvic pain (median 
Δ-NRS, 0 (IQR, -2 to 0) vs 0 (IQR, 0-1); P = 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: In women with DIE, PFP seems to result in increased LHA on Valsalva 
maneuver, as observed by 3D/4D transperineal ultrasound, leading to improved
superficial dyspareunia, chronic pelvic pain and pelvic floor muscle relaxation.

Endometriosis (EMs) is a common cause for female infertility, leading to the need
for in vitro fertilization (IVF). In clinics, we found the operative oocyte
retrieval to be more or less difficult in women with EMs. We hypothesized that
EMs may be involved in the insufficient cumulus expansion that partially
explained the lower oocyte retrieval in EMs-related infertile women undergoing
assisted reproductive technology (ART). To explore whether the insufficient
cumulus expansion exists in EMs-related infertile women and whether there is a
possible relationship between the insufficient cumulus expansion and the clinical
phenomenon of difficulty in oocyte retrieval. Those infertile women undergoing
IVF recorded in our database between January 2013 and October 2017 were included.
The expression levels of cumulus expansion-related genes
(HAS2/PTGS2/PTX3/TNFAIP6) in the cumulus cells (CCs) from 19 infertile women with
EMs and 24 controls were analyzed by real-time PCR. After that, 635 women with
EMs-associated infertility (the EMs group) and 4634 women with male
factor-associated infertility (the control group) were included in the
retrospective analysis. The clinical outcomes were compared between the two
groups. The relative mRNA levels of cumulus expansion-related genes were
significantly decreased in the CCs from those infertile women with EMs when
compared to the control group (all p < 0.05), especially the expression of PTGS2.
The mean oocyte retrieval rates (proportion of obtained oocytes in punctured
follicles) were (76.33 ± 2.58)% and (71.80 ± 0.58)% (p < 0.01). The mean numbers 
of flushing times per follicle were 1.11 ± 0.65 and 3.86 ± 1.53 (p < 0.001). The 
lower expression of cumulus expansion-related genes in CCs suggests the
insufficient cumulus expansion in EMs-related infertile women, which partially
explains a possible mechanism related to poor oocyte retrieval.

Acute appendicitis is an important differential diagnosis in patients with right 
lower quadrant pain during pregnancy. Endometriosis, a hormone-related pathology,
is another possibility. Patients with endometriosis are typically symptomatic
before pregnancy. Stromal endometriosis is a variant of endometriosis that
presents no symptoms before pregnancy but which occasionally presents with the
new onset of symptoms during pregnancy. We report the case of a 35-year-old woman
in her 8th month of pregnancy who presented with impending appendiceal rupture
due to deciduosis of the appendix, a progesterone-related condition, during
pregnancy. This case suggests that deciduosis/stromal endometriosis should be
considered as a differential diagnosis of acute abdomen during pregnancy, even if
the patient is asymptomatic before pregnancy.

This video shows the surgical excision of a 20-cm peritoneal inclusion cyst with 
laparoscopic repair of pelvic floor defects caused by the mass effect of the
cyst. A 44-year-old woman presented with bulge symptoms and a reducible posterior
prolapse extending 4 cm beyond the introitus inconsistent with an
enterocele/rectocele. Dynamic MRI revealed a 20-cm cystic mass surrounding the
uterine fundus extending down the posterior wall of the vagina, anterior to the
rectum. Robotic-assisted laparoscopy revealed stage-IV endometriosis and a large 
peritoneal inclusion cyst extending from the pelvic brim to the rectovaginal
septum. The cyst was mobilized through retroperitoneal dissection. Redundant
peritoneum was excised down to the perineal body, and the distended posterior
vaginal wall was plicated laparoscopically. The peritoneum was closed in a
purse-string fashion, obliterating any potential space. Resolution of the
prolapse was confirmed along with restoration of normal anatomy. We managed a
unique case of a large peritoneal inclusion cyst presenting as vaginal prolapse. 
To correct defects after cystectomy, laparoscopic repair was performed similarly 
to closing an enterocele. Repair of a high posterior defect can be performed
laparoscopically when working abdominally to avoid vaginal incisions, allowing
for excellent visualization and access.

AIM: Endometriosis is associated with infertility. The aim of this study was to
examine the overall proteomic changes of eutopic endometrium in infertile women
with endometriosis.
METHODS: Tandem mass tags combined with multidimensional liquid chromatography
and mass spectrometry analyses were used to screen the proteomic profiles of
eutopic endometrium from infertile patients with endometriosis (N = 4), compared 
with that from patients without endometriosis (N = 4). Quantitative proteomic
analysis, functional categories and significant pathway analysis were
investigated subsequently.
RESULTS: In total, 6.698 proteins were identified, among which 5,812 proteins
were quantified. Compared with controls, proteomic analysis showed some
differentially expressed proteins: 16 up-regulated proteins and 23 down-regulated
proteins. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that differentially expressed
proteins were involved in humoral immune response pathways, antimicrobial humoral
response and regulation of nitric oxide biosynthetic process. Besides, our
results showed that alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 2, complement factor B and zinc
transporter Zip14 were important resources for investigating potential mechanism 
of infertility in infertile women with endometriosis.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provided a reference proteome map of eutopic endometrium 
from infertile women with endometriosis. The long-term benefits of using those
markers to stratify clinical treatment warrant further investigation.

OBJECTIVE: To examine whether a modified endometriosis fertility index (EFI) can 
better predict the rate of pregnancy without assisted reproductive technologies
(ART) after laparoscopic surgery in infertile Chinese women with endometriosis.
METHODS: 564 infertile women undergoing laparoscopy for endometriosis were
retrospectively collected from January 2014 to December 2018. 472 patients were
used to modify the EFI based on new, optimal cutoffs for its predictor variables.
The predictive accuracy of the modified EFI was examined in the other 92
patients.
RESULTS: Among the patients for the EFI modification, the multivariable Cox
regression results showed that historical factors made more contribution in
predicting non-ART pregnancy rate than surgical factors both in modified EFI
(C-index: historical factors 0.617 vs surgical factors 0.558) and original EFI
(C-index: historical factors 0.600 vs surgical factors 0.549). No significant
relationship between the prior pregnancy and post-operative non-ART pregnancy
rates was detected by both modified EFI and original EFI (p = 0.530 and 0.802,
respectively). To assess the predictive effect of modified EFI, the two versions 
of modified EFI not only had higher predictive accuracy (C-index: 0.627 and
0.632) for non-ART pregnancy rates than that of the original EFI (C-index: 0.602)
in the patients undergoing surgery during 2014-2017, but also higher than that of
the original EFI (C-index: 0.638 and 0.612 vs 0.560) in the externally validated 
population in 2018.
CONCLUSIONS: A modified EFI based on population-specific optimal cutoffs and
weights might be more suitable for estimating the rate of non-ART pregnancy after
laparoscopic surgery in infertile women with endometriosis.

OBJECTIVE: To compare vaginally-assisted natural orifices endoscopic transluminal
endoscopic surgery (vNOTES) hysterectomy with salpingectomy/salpingo-oophorectomy
with standard laparoscopic access.
METHODS: Medical records for patients undergoing hysterectomy with adnexectomy
for benign disease indication between February 1, 2019 and February 1, 2020 were 
retrospectively examined. Exclusion criteria were endometriosis, previous pelvic 
radiotherapy, inflammatory pelvic disease history, any other concurrent surgery, 
laparotomy, robotic surgery, and/or traditional vaginal hysterectomy.
RESULTS: Among 86 patients, 21 (24.4%) were allocated to a vNOTES group and 65
(75.6%) were allocated to a conventional laparoscopy (LAP) group. Mean ages for
the groups were 47.19 ± 11.11 years and 46.69 ± 9.11 years, respectively
(P = 0.928). There were no statistically significant differences in age, body
mass index, arterial hypertension/diabetes, smoking, menopausal status, obstetric
history, number of abdominal surgeries, or preoperative hemoglobin level between 
the two groups. The mean (range) operative times were 111.90 min (80-180 min) in 
the vNOTES group and 113.98 min (64-350 min) in the LAP group (P = 0.904). There 
were no statistically significant differences in terms of surgery indication,
specific and unspecific complications, conversions, blood transfusion,
reoperation, significant ileus/emesis, and hospital stay.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the parameters assessed, we found vNOTES to be comparable
to laparoscopy among our cohort.

INTRODUCTION: There is increasing evidence that intermediate and long-term bowel 
dysfunction may occur as a consequence of radical surgery for rectal deep
endometriosis (DE). Typical symptoms include constipation, feeling of incomplete 
evacuation, clustering of stools, and urgency. This is described in the
colorectal surgical literature as low anterior resection syndrome (LARS). Within 
this, several studies suggested that differences regarding functional outcomes
could be favorable to more conservative surgical approaches, that is, excision of
endometriotic tissue with preservation of the luminal structure of the rectal
wall when compared with classical segmental resection techniques for DE,
especially when performed for low DE.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 211 patients undergoing rectal surgery for low
DE (≤7 cm from the anal verge) in three different tertiary referral centers
between October 2009 and December 2018 were retrospectively reviewed regarding
major complications and LARS. From the 211 eligible patients, six women were
excluded because of loss to follow-up. Finally, a total number of 205 patients
were enrolled for the statistical analysis; 139 with nerve- and vessel-sparing
segmental resection (NVSSR) and 66 operated for laparoscopic-transanal disk
excision (LTADE) were included. Gastrointestinal functional outcomes of the two
procedures were compared using the validated LARS questionnaire. The median
follow-up time was 46 ± 11 months. As a secondary outcome, the surgical sequelae 
were examined.
RESULTS: We found no statistically significant difference between the incidence
of LARS (31.7% and 37.9%, respectively) among patients operated by LTADE when
compared with NVSSR (P = .4). The occurrence of LARS was positively associated
with the use of protective ileostomy or colostomy (P = .02). A higher rate of
severe complications was observed in women undergoing LTADE (19.7%) when compared
with patients with NVSSR (9.0%, P = .029).
CONCLUSIONS: LARS is not more frequent after NVSSR when compared with a more
conservative approach such as LTADE in patients undergoing rectal surgery for low
DE. To confirm our findings prospective studies are required.

Depression, Anxiety, and Self-Directed Violence in Women With Endometriosis: A
Retrospective Matched-Cohort Study.

Estes SJ, Huisingh CE, Chiuve SE, Petruski-Ivleva N, Missmer SA.

The purpose of this study was to compare the incidence of mental health outcomes 
in women in the United States with and without documented endometriosis. In a
retrospective matched-cohort study using administrative health claims data from
Optum's Clinformatics DataMart from May 1, 2000, through March 31, 2019, women
aged 18-50 years with endometriosis (n = 72,677), identified by International
Classification of Disease diagnosis codes (revisions 9 or 10), were matched 1:2
on age and calendar time to women without endometriosis (n = 147,251), with a
median follow-up of 529 days (interquartile range, 195, 1,164). The rate per
1,000 person-years of anxiety, depression, and self-directed violence among women
with endometriosis was 57.1, 47.7, and 0.9, respectively. Comparing women with
endometriosis to those without, the adjusted hazard ratios and 95% confidence
intervals were 1.38 (1.34, 1.42) for anxiety, 1.48 (1.44, 1.53) for depression,
and 2.03 (1.60, 2.58) for self-directed violence. The association with depression
was stronger among women younger than 35 years (P for heterogeneity < 0.01). Risk
factors for incident depression, anxiety, and self-directed violence among women 
with endometriosis included endometriosis-related pain symptoms and prevalence of
other chronic conditions associated with pain. The identification of risk factors
for mental health conditions among women with endometriosis may improve
patient-centered disease management.

Endometriosis is a gynocological disease characterized by the presence of the
endometrial glands and stroma outside the uterine cavity. This disease affects % 
6-10 of women with reproductive age and it causes serious problems such as pelvic
pain, dysmenorrhea and infertility. Although endometriosis is one of the most
investigated disease of gynecology, its pathogenesis is not clear completely. In 
recent years, many studies revealed the inflammatory nature of endometriosis.
Many of the immune cells and their secretory products cytokines and chemokines
has been detected in body fluids of women with endometriosis. Cytokines are
protein or glycoprotein in structures and hormon-like molecules that act
generally in a paracrine fashion to regulate immun responses. They involved in
chemotaxis, cell proliferation, cell activation, motility, adhesion and
morphogenesis. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) is a proinflammatory cytokine 
secreted by the macrophages, monocytes, neutrophiles, T cells and natural killer 
cells. It stimulates increase in the level of the chemokines in body fluids.
Monocyte chemotactic protein 2 (MCP-2) is a chemokine act to recruit and activate
monocytes into sites of inflammation area. The aim of this study to investigate
the ultrastructural properties and whether the expression and localization of
TNF-α and MCP-2 in the eutopic endometrium (normal endometrium of women with
endometriosis) and endometritic tissues of women with endometriosis. Eutopic
endometrial and endometriotic tissue samples were obtained from women with
endometriosis between 20-41 y and normal endometrial tissues were collected from 
5 women without endometriosis as a control group. Tissues were processed for
light and electron microscopy and examined. The epithelial cells of endometriotic
tissues were revealed strongly cytoplasmic TNF-α and MCP-2 immunreactivities.
Eutopic endometrial tissues were also stained prominently for both TNF-α and
MCP-2. Furthermore, a significant increase in stromal macrophages were observed
in endometriotic tissues. Moreover, the ultrastructural observations on the
normal and endometriotic tissues were exhibited microvilli-rich cells and
ciliated cells. These findings suggest that TNF-α and MCP-2 may be involved in
normal endometrial biology and in the pathogenesis of endometriosis.

AIM: To explore the relationship of urinary concentrations of different congeners
of benzophenones and parabens with the utilization of cosmetics and personal care
products (PCPs) and their impact on the risk of endometriosis, and to evaluate
the influence of oxidative stress on associations found.
METHODS: This case-control study comprised a subsample of 124 women (35 cases; 89
controls). Endometriosis was confirmed (cases) or ruled out (controls) by
laparoscopy, with visual inspection of the pelvis and biopsy of suspected lesions
(histological diagnosis). Urinary concentrations of benzophenone-1 (BP-1),
benzophenone-3 (BP-3), 4-hydroxibenzophenone (4-OH-BP), methyl- (MeP), ethyl-
(EtP), propyl- (PrP), and butyl-paraben (BuP), and biomarkers of oxidative stress
[lipid peroxidation (TBARS) and total antioxidant power (TAP)] were quantified.
Information was gathered on the frequency of use of cosmetics and PCPs.
Associations between the frequency of cosmetics/PCP use, urinary concentrations
of benzophenones and parabens, oxidative stress, and endometriosis risk were
explored in logistic and linear multivariable regression analyses.
RESULTS: The frequency of utilization of certain cosmetics and PCPs was
significantly associated with urinary concentrations of benzophenones and
parabens. After adjustment for potential confounders, the risk of endometriosis
was increased in women in the second versus first terciles of MeP (OR = 5.63;
p-value<0.001), BP-1 (OR = 5.12; p-value = 0.011), BP-3 (OR = 4.98;
p-value = 0.008), and ƩBPs (OR = 3.34; p-value = 0.032). A close-to-significant
relationship was observed between TBARS concentrations and increased
endometriosis risk (OR = 1.60, p-value = 0.070) and an inverse association
between TAP concentrations and this risk (OR = 0.15; p-value = 0.048). Oxidative 
stress results did not modify associations observed between benzophenone/paraben 
exposure and endometriosis risk.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that the frequency of cosmetics and PCP
utilization is a strong predictor of exposure to certain benzophenone and paraben
congeners. These compounds may increase the risk of endometriosis in an oxidative
stress-independent manner. Further studies are warranted to corroborate these
findings.

INTRODUCTION: High-dose progestins are used as an effective therapy for painful
symptoms of endometriosis but their impact on sexual function has been poorly
studied. The study aims to assess the impact of high-dose progestin on sexual
function among women treated for endometriosis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this bicenter prospective observational study, women
with endometriosis who received medical or surgical treatment for endometriosis
and who were sexually active were included. They completed the Sexual Activity
Questionnaire (SAQ, a validated tool) before (T0) and 12 months after (T1)
endometriosis treatment. We classified patients into two groups according to
whether they were using high-dose progestins at T1: a high-dose progestin group
and a control group. The main outcome was sexual function measured by the SAQ
score (from 0 to 30) at T1. The secondary outcomes were each individual SAQ item,
the dyspareunia 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS) and the quality of life assessed
with EuroQoL Group 5D Index (EQ-5D) at T1. We also assessed the change in
dyspareunia VAS and quality of life between T0 and T1. The Ethics Committee of
Ile-de-France (Act 2004-806, 9 August 2004) approved the study.
RESULTS: Among 214 women included, 25 (12%) were exposed to high-dose progestins 
at T1. The SAQ score of women exposed to high-dose progestins was significantly
lower compared with the control group, with or without adjustment for covariates 
(15.5 ± 6.3 vs 18.3 ± 6.2, P = .03, adjusted effect size -0.44 [95% CI -0.86 to
-0.02], P = .04). High-dose progestin intake at T1 was associated with a lower
subscore on two SAQ items: pleasure (1.8 ± 0.8 vs 2.2 ± 0.9, P = .02), and
satisfaction with frequency of intercourse (1.2 ± 1.2 vs 1.8 ± 1.1, P = .02). In 
the overall population, dyspareunia VAS and quality of life assessed by EQ-5D
improved between T0 and T1 (45 ± 29 at T0 vs 28 ± 29 at T1, P < .001; 0.78 ± 0.14
at T0 vs 0.86 ± 0.14 at T1, P < .001, respectively). At T1, the groups did not
differ significantly for dyspareunia VAS (effect size 0.36 [95% CI -0.06 to
0.78], P = .10) and quality of life (EQ-5D, effect size 0.02 [95% CI -0.40 to
0.44], P = .91).
CONCLUSION: In this observational study, high-dose progestins impair the sexual
function of women treated for endometriosis even though they improved
dyspareunia.

Mutations and other molecular events involving subunits of the SWI/SNF chromatin 
remodelling complex are common in a wide variety of malignancies, including those
arising at various sites in the female genital tract. Endometrioid and clear cell
carcinomas in the uterine corpus and ovary not uncommonly contain mutations in
ARID1A and these also occur in other endometriosis-associated ovarian neoplasms
such as seromucinous tumours. In these organs, mutations in SMARCA4, SMARCB1,
ARID1A and ARID1B (with subsequent loss of corresponding protein expression as a 
reliable surrogate) are relatively common in undifferentiated carcinomas,
including the undifferentiated component of dedifferentiated carcinoma. SMARCA4
mutations are extremely common (almost ubiquitous) in small cell carcinoma of the
ovary of hypercalcaemic type (SCCOHT), occurring in about 98% of these neoplasms,
often in association with epigenetic SMARCA2 loss. SMARCB1-deficient vulval
neoplasms include epithelioid sarcoma and myoepithelial carcinoma, as well as
related malignancies which defy easy classification. Recently the spectrum of
SWI/SNF deficient female genital malignancies has been expanded to include
SMARCA4-deficient undifferentiated uterine sarcoma and mural nodules of
anaplastic carcinoma in ovarian mucinous neoplasms.

The prevalence of female infertility cases has been increasing at a frightening
rate, affecting approximately 48 million women across the world. However,
oxidative stress has been recognized as one of the main mediators of female
infertility by causing various reproductive pathologies in females such as
endometriosis, PCOS, preeclampsia, spontaneous abortion, and unexplained
infertility. Nowadays, concerned women prefer dietary supplements with
antioxidant properties over synthetic drugs as a natural way to lessen the
oxidative stress and enhance their fertility. Therefore, the current review is an
attempt to explore the efficacy of various natural antioxidant compounds
including vitamins, carotenoids, and plant polyphenols and also of some medicinal
plants in improving the fertility status of females. Our summarization of recent 
findings in the current article would pave the way toward the development of new 
possible antioxidant therapy to treat infertility in females. Natural antioxidant
compounds found in fruits, vegetables, and other dietary sources, alone or in
combination with other antioxidants, were found to be effective in ameliorating
the oxidative stress-mediated infertility problems in both natural and assisted
reproductive settings. Numerous medicinal plants showed promising results in
averting the various reproductive disorders associated with female infertility,
suggesting a plant-based herbal medicine to treat infertility. Although optimum
levels of natural antioxidants have shown favorable results, however, their
excessive intake may have adverse health impacts. Therefore, larger
well-designed, dose-response studies in humans are further warranted to
incorporate natural antioxidant compounds into the clinical management of female 
infertility.

Parallel worlds and personified pain: A mixed-methods analysis of pain metaphor
use by women with endometriosis.

OBJECTIVES: Endometriosis is a long-term condition in which endometrial-like
tissue grows outside of the womb, causing intense chronic pain. Previous work has
demonstrated the physical and emotional impact on women who live with
endometriosis, and metaphors can play an influential role in communicating the
experience of pain, but there exists little understanding of the role and impact 
of such language for women with endometriosis.
DESIGN: A qualitative, semi-structured interview design.
METHODS: Conceptual Metaphor Theory (CMT) and Interpretative Phenomenological
Analysis (IPA) were utilized in a mixed-methods study to examine the prevalence, 
types, and meaning of metaphors and metaphor use as a health communication
strategy. Twenty-one women aged between 23 and 53 years (mean age 36.1 years)
with endometriosis took part in audio-recorded interviews.
RESULTS: The women reported experiencing symptoms for an average of 11 years
before receiving a formal diagnosis of endometriosis, and the mean age of
diagnosis was 27.6 years. Seven distinct conceptual metaphors were identified in 
221 metaphorical expressions used across all participants, with most common ones 
referring to pain as physical properties of elements such as temperature and
pressure, physical damage, and an external attacker. IPA revealed three themes
pertaining to the feeling of vulnerability and helplessness, pain being
incomprehensible, and a drive to manage and conceal pain simultaneously.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the power of language in facilitating
understanding and empathy in the listener, alongside the challenge of
communicating endometriosis pain to others. Imagery-based techniques may assist
in adaptation to, interpretation, and acceptance of pain to reduce pain-related
distress.

STUDY OBJECTIVE: To present a series of robotic laparoendoscopic single-site
surgery (LESS) and reduced-port hysterectomy cases and discuss the surgical
technique required for successful use on this new platform.
DESIGN: Retrospective case series.
SETTING: Academic medical center.
PATIENTS: All patients undergoing robotic LESS or reduced-port hysterectomy with 
the SP1098 da Vinci SP Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA) from
December 2019 to March 2020.
INTERVENTIONS: Robotic LESS or reduced-port hysterectomy.
MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 8 cases of hysterectomy were performed 
successfully. Four cases included concomitant resection of endometriosis. Five
cases required placement of an additional port. The average uterine weight was
136.1 g ± 61.5 g (range 87-246). The average estimated blood loss was 37.5 mL ±
27 mL (range 20-100). The average operative time was 86.5 minutes ± 27.1 minutes 
(range 60-132). The time required for vaginal cuff closure was available for
patients 5 to 8, and ranged from 10 minutes to 13 minutes. All patients had
same-day discharge. There were no conversions to alternative surgical modality,
complications, or readmissions.
CONCLUSION: Our preliminary experience with the SP1098 da Vinci SP Surgical
System demonstrated the technical feasibility and safety of this surgical
modality for gynecologic surgery. Additional studies examining postoperative

OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical and ultrasound characteristics of accessory
cavitated uterine malformations (ACUMs).
METHODS: This was a single-center observational study of consecutive patients
diagnosed with an ACUM, who had undergone an ultrasound examination by an
experienced ultrasound examiner between January 2013 and May 2019, identified
retrospectively from medical records. ACUM was diagnosed when a cavitated lesion 
with a myometrial mantle and echogenic contents was seen within the anterolateral
wall of the myometrium beneath the insertion of the round ligament. In all women,
presenting symptoms and clinical history were recorded along with detailed
descriptions of the lesions and any concomitant pelvic abnormalities.
RESULTS: Twenty patients diagnosed with an ACUM were identified. Median age was
29.2 (interquartile range, 25.0-35.8) years. None of the women was premenarchal
or postmenopausal. All of the women reported painful periods or pelvic pain and
none of them reported subfertility. Twelve of the ACUMs were in the right
anterolateral myometrium and eight were in the left anterolateral myometrium.
Both a myometrial mantle and a fluid-filled cavity were considered to be defining
features on ultrasound. The fluid contained within the cavity was either
echogenic with a ground-glass appearance or hyperechoic. All of the lesions were 
spherical in shape. The Doppler flow seen in the outer rim was not markedly
different from that of the surrounding myometrium, and the content of the cavity 
was avascular on Doppler examination. The mean outer cavity diameter of the ACUMs
was 22.8 (95% CI, 20.9-24.8) mm and the mean internal cavity diameter was 14.1
(95% CI, 12.2-16.1) mm. Four women opted for transvaginal ultrasound-guided
alcohol sclerotherapy. Surgical excision was carried out in eight cases, and the 
diagnosis was confirmed on histopathological examination in all of them.
CONCLUSIONS: ACUMs are a uterine abnormality with a distinct ultrasound
appearance, which are associated with dysmenorrhea and chronic pelvic pain.
Knowledge of their typical appearance on ultrasound could facilitate early
detection and treatment. There are several treatment options for ACUM, ranging
from simple analgesia to complete excision. Further prospective and longitudinal 
studies are required to study the prevalence and natural history of this
condition. © 2020 International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and

Vilaprisan is a novel selective progesterone receptor modulator for the long-term
treatment of uterine fibroids and endometriosis. This study investigated the
pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of vilaprisan in healthy Chinese
postmenopausal women. Twelve participants received multiple doses of vilaprisan
once daily over 14 days as a 2-mg tablet. Plasma vilaprisan concentrations were
determined using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The main
pharmacokinetic parameters of vilaprisan were assessed with noncompartmental
analysis, including maximum observed concentration (Cmax ), systemic exposure
(area under the plasma concentration-time curve), time to reach Cmax and terminal
half-life. Safety assessments include the documentation of adverse events,
measurement of clinical/anthropometric parameters and vital signs,
electrocardiogram, and physical and gynecologic examination. The participants had
a mean age of 53.3 (± 4.2) years and a body mass index of 23.8 ± 2.8 kg/m2 .
Median time to reach Cmax was 1.5 hours after both single and multiple vilaprisan
administration. Mean Cmax values obtained after multiple dosing (23.3 μg/L
[standard deviation (SD) = 6.73]) were 1.92-fold (SD = 0.554) higher compared to 
single dosing (12.5 μg/L [SD = 3.04]). Mean area under the plasma
concentration-time curve in the dosing interval increased with an accumulation
factor of 2.98 (SD = 0.767) between single (91.3 μg · h/L [SD = 20.4]) and
multiple dosing (276 μg · h/L [SD = 109]). The mean terminal half-life of
vilaprisan was 44.5 hours (SD = 10.3) after multiple dosing. Mild to moderate
adverse events were observed similar to previous studies. Overall, daily oral
administration of the therapeutic dose of 2 mg of vilaprisan over 14 days was
safe and well tolerated by all participants.

INTRODUCTION: Oocyte competence and quality depend on communication between the
oocyte and the cumulus and theca cells. In the preantral phase, the members of
the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) superfamily are responsible for this
communication and play an important role in folliculogenesis. Members of the
TGF-β superfamily are related to endometriosis (overexpression in the ectopic
endometrium); however, few studies have explored these proteins as influencing
fertility in endometriosis. Considering endometriosis-related infertility and to 
better understand the role of the TGF-β superfamily members in the antral phase
in women with endometriosis, this research investigated the gene expression of
the genes for ligands AMH, BMP-6, GDF-9, INHA, INHBB, and TGFβ3; receptors AMHR2,
BMPR2, and TGFβR3; and intracellular signalling: SMAD3 and SMAD4.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The gene expression of AMH, BMP-6, GDF-9, INHA, INHBB,
TGFβ3, AMHR2, BMPR2, TGFβR3, SMAD3, and SMAD4 in cumulus cells was investigated
through quantitative real-time PCR in a case-control study including infertile
women with and without peritoneal endometriosis undergoing in vitro
fertilization.
RESULTS: Age and outcomes of assisted reproduction were similar between the
groups (P > .05). However, women with endometriosis showed reduced expression of 
BMP-6 and SMAD4 (P < .05) in cumulus cells compared with the control group, other
genes did not present altered gene expression in women with endometriosis
(P > .05).
CONCLUSIONS: The reduced expression of BMP-6 and SMAD4 in women with peritoneal
endometriosis compared with the control group indicates that granulosa (cumulus) 
cell function could be altered in these women.

Background: Endometriosis does not have a well-established physiopathology. It
has been addressed that endometriosis is an inflammatory disease, where
endocrine-immunological interactions are probably involved in the pathogenesis of
the disease. The role of the immune system in endometriosis has been suggested to
play an important role in both initiation and progression of the disease.Methods:
A search for the following keywords was performed in the PubMed database:
"endometriosis", "endometriosis and ovarian cancer", "endometriosis and
immunology", and "endometriosis and cytokines".Results: The articles identified
were published in English between 1921 and 2020. We selected 100 articles for
further analysis.Conclusion: The recognition of the direct involvement of these
two important physiological mechanisms causes a change in the pathophysiological 
focus of the disease. Researching the activities of numerous cells involved in
immune reactions may offer new therapeutic targets.

Ovarian carcinoma with a somatically derived yolk sac tumor component is a
phenomenon known to mostly occur in postmenopausal women. Herein, we report an
ovarian endometriosis-associated somatic yolk sac tumor arising in the background
of a low-grade endometrioid adenocarcinoma in a young woman. A 27-yr-old woman
presented with abdominal pain, subsequently recognized to be caused by a right
ovarian mass undergoing torsion. Following operative management, microscopic
examination of the salpingo-oophorectomy specimen showed endometriosis and a
predominantly cystic ovarian neoplasm with 2 distinct phenotypic areas: (1) a
yolk sac tumor component containing Schiller-Duval bodies and (2) a low-grade
endometrioid carcinoma component with squamous metaplasia. Immunohistochemical
evaluation showed distinct profiles in the yolk sac tumor (estrogen
receptor/progesterone receptor/PAX8 negative, SALL4/Glypican 3 positive) and
endometrioid (estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor/PAX8 positive,
SALL4/Glypican 3 negative) components. Given these findings, the diagnosis of an 
endometriosis-associated endometrioid adenocarcinoma with a somatically derived
yolk sac tumor was rendered. The tumor was staged as pT1c1 due to intraoperative 
spillage. The patient underwent chemotherapeutic treatment and after 15 mo of
follow-up, she was alive with no evidence of recurrence. This example
demonstrates that somatic yolk sac tumor differentiation in ovarian epithelial
neoplasia can occur in young patients; awareness of this phenomenon is important 
as somatic and germ cell yolk sac neoplasia have different behavior and therapy.
