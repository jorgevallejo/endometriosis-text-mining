	abstract = {Endometriosis is a disease characterized by the development of endometrial tissue outside the uterus, but its cause remains largely unknown. Numerous genes have been studied and proposed to help explain its pathogenesis. However, the large number of these candidate genes has made functional validation through experimental methodologies nearly impossible. Computational methods could provide a useful alternative for prioritizing those most likely to be susceptibility genes. Using artificial intelligence applied to text mining, this study analyzed the genes involved in the pathogenesis, development, and progression of endometriosis. The data extraction by text mining of the endometriosis-related genes in the PubMed database was based on natural language processing, and the data were filtered to remove false positives. Using data from the text mining and gene network information as input for the web-based tool, 15,207 endometriosis-related genes were ranked according to their score in the database. Characterization of the filtered gene set through gene ontology, pathway, and network analysis provided information about the numerous mechanisms hypothesized to be responsible for the establishment of ectopic endometrial tissue, as well as the migration, implantation, survival, and proliferation of ectopic endometrial cells. Finally, the human genome was scanned through various databases using filtered genes as a seed to determine novel genes that might also be involved in the pathogenesis of endometriosis but which have not yet been characterized. These genes could be promising candidates to serve as useful diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in the management of endometriosis.},

	abstract = {Endometriosis is an enigmatic disease that could start at birth. Its pathogenesis is supported by different theories. Accumulating facts relate it to a multigenic disorder. In this review of recent publications, the principal symptoms of the disease, pain and infertility, as well as its pathogenesis, diagnosis, and classification will be addressed. Endometriosis presents three main variants: superficial peritoneal disease, deep infiltrating endometriosis, and ovarian endometriomas. The management of the disease, surgery, and medical and alternative therapies will be discussed. Special reference will be made to the quality of surgery and how to understand patients with endometriosis and endometriosis.},
